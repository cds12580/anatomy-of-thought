        <h3>Preambel</h3>
        <p>Paradigm shift is a term coined by Thomas Kuhn describing that progress in knowledge is rarely steady and smooth, but occurs in waves of disruptive discoveries. Moreover, it’s not even a monotonic way forward. Successful ideas draw an (unwarranted) avalanche of subsequent studies, while failing approaches are oftentimes unjustifiably and prematurely abandoned just to be rediscovered later on. Only once a popular idea wears off, forgotten concepts might receive renewed appreciation. Inertia of opinion can lead to overshooting and undershooting in similar ways as price rigidities in an economic context. The path to understanding is therefore not an ever-climbing slope with local pushes and pulls, but bends back and forth like the saddle path around the equilibrium in Dornbusch’s model. In this essay, we want to revisit some of those past pathways not taken and explore them further to see how they can play together with more contemporary ideas. This essay is more about recombining in novel ways than breaking new grounds. Some sections are directly copied from other authors (to whom I apologize for not properly keeping track of sources), who said it before me and who said it much better than I ever could (I apologize to the reader for the unpolished and unpleasant writing in the remaining parts). The emphasis of this treatise lies on the merger of ideas and not the parts themselves. In fact, one takeaway is—following Hume’s Copy Principle— that any new knowledge always amounts to a amalgamation of the formerly known under the sporadic influence of mutations. We are interested in giving a unified account of different expressions of mental activity at the price profundity and detail. Large bodies of knowledge exist for individual domains; we want to elaborate a common framework and prepare a common language between disconnected fields. Original observations, or ‘mutations’, within this approach could be seen in the way we treat the whole scene as a ‘gestalt’, the Relevance Rule of overlap, the interplay of hard and soft information, or the interpretation of dreaming, among others. </p>
        <p>Today the dominant theories explaining mental operations are Bayesian. Bayesian models are very successful at reproducing real-life observations. Yet, the discussion about whether Bayesian inference is how the brain works, or whether it’s only a suitable approximation that delivers results that happen to emulate nature is not yet settled. Doubts persist whether the brain really is first and foremost a prediction machine. If brains are Bayesian, which is to say that predictive processing is the fundamental principle of cognition, it would mean that all sensing, feeling, thinking, and doing is a matter of making predictions; which is a very strong assumption. Other voices point out that “many of the so-called ‘predictive-coding theories’ of sensory and perceptual processing do not predict forward in time and are not in line with physiological and psychological phenomena. And, neocortex is not a feedforward architecture. […] But for every feedforward connection there is a corresponding feedback connection, and there is little or no consensus about the function(s) of these feedback connections.” Some are chary as to how well irrational behavior can be described in a Bayesian context. The objection that natural selection aims to be ‘good enough’ rather than optimal goes straight to the heart of the criticism. </p>
        <p>Most Bayesianists view themselves in a Helmholtzian tradition or locate their theoretic origins directly with to Ibn Al Haytham. British empiricism is often heedlessly omitted even though the accounts of thinkers like David Hume and John Stuart Mill are shrewd and profuse. The Associationist School is the ancestor of modern-day Bayesianism and the present framework is its close cousin. This framework tries to incorporate Humean skepticism into today’s optimal strategies and settles for nature’s ‘good-enough’ approach to problem solving. Rational Bayesian models are significantly unconstrained. There are doubts as to the efficacy of current approaches to exploring capacity limitations. It would be a curious coincidence if existing mathematical estimation techniques just happened to align with biological constraints. The psychological implications of most Bayesian models are also unclear. Once all capacity limitations are detailed, notions of rationality lose force. Each person can be viewed as an optimal version of himself given his own limitations, flawed beliefs, motivational limitations, etc. At such a point, it is not clear what work the rational analysis is doing. In the present framework, we start off with the premise of the organism’s limitations, mainly through the route of Hume’s Copy Principle.</p>
        <p>This framework and Bayesian models are very close kin. So close indeed, that differences oftentimes become blurry or vanish altogether. Both infer certain things if we know other related things, and in both an internal model reflects external processes. In a Bayesian context, this happens mainly in terms of probabilities. Here it is much more a matter of matching past experiences against an unknown present. This matching sequence is mainly a refinement process in which habit (experience) guides the detection of distinguishing features. The Bayesian expectation lies closer to the prior if sensory uncertainty is high. In our framework the up-tree resolution (which can jump from one branch to another) gets stuck prematurely. In fact, due to the Inadequacy Principle (explained later), the patch can never be perfect because every object is a resemblance (metaphor) of some previously observed object. All recognition is therefore a matter of degree. Weighting of prediction error has been associated with attention, which corresponds to the snatch-patch ratio of this framework. As long as no patch is served, curiosity is kept alive and snatching continues (this process can work adversely in the case of blocking). </p>
        <p>Just like in a Bayesian context, patch approximations can be non-monotonic; as the snatch becomes more detailed, the patch updates. But it’s not a simultaneous comparison of alternatives, rather a wheel of fortune that comes to a halt as time runs out and a decision has to be made. The patch not only fills out what is perceived but contains the meaning; it shapes what we see, as is the case for higher-order concepts in Bayesian networks. There is also a latent tendency to prefer patching over snatching and learning everything anew, leading to similar dynamics as under predictive coding. The big difference lies in shifting the whole process into the present; the future component is rather a side effect as some patches happen to run into the future. The brain therefore is not a prediction machine, but a present-completion device in a Lewinian sense. Different patch sizes (time horizons) correspond to different mental activity—as in Bayesian models where motor action is linked to smaller time scales—and different degrees of consciousness—comparable to Integrated Information Theory. Under a general principle of free energy minimization, agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action). In the present framework the rules for thought and motion are the same for both, too. Jump-and-roll reasoning, united under the Relevance Rule, apply equally to the inside and the outside. Humean habit leads to the process of learning and practice: world points are added and removed from a pattern respecting the gestalt forces of simplicity and stability. Bayesian observations add to existing evidence and hypotheses could have been learned, both facts are in line with Hume’s Copy Principle. The equivalent to an initial belief of how strongly the subject believes in each hypothesis before observing data, is implicitly determined by the containing scene in which a certain event occurs. We will explore these concepts one by one.</p>

        <h4 id="section1">Section 1: Symbolic Animals</h4>
        <p>Time is life’s most defining feature. Death is infinite; life is not. At the same time, the organism’s life span is always strictly larger than zero. For an organism to survive, it must read its environment and react to it. It is conscious of its surroundings in some way. This interpretation process is time consuming; consciousness requires a time horizon larger than zero, and a time horizon larger than zero means that an organism is alive and conscious in a rudimentary sense. Higher developed animals and humans possess brains as dedicated organs for the interpretation process. The brain is the ‘organ of time’. Time is the number of events occurring between two states. Usually we pick naturally, and above all, regularly recurring events such as planetary movements or resonators. Yet, any event fits the purpose; the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee would be a valid description as well. Every event has its extension in time space. Time is what keeps everything from happening at once, as comedian Ray Cummings pointed out. Conversely, if nothing is happening there is no time. Saint Augustine wrote in his Confessions, “before Heaven and Earth there was no time”. He also remarked that there is only a moment of present time; it can only be observed or measured while it’s passing. Times are measured in proportion as they pass by. It is in the human mind, which expects, considers, and remembers, he wrote. Two opposing forces create those events that are the foundations of time: assembly and decay, order and chaos, life and death. </p>
        <p>Rudolf Clausius had just developed the concept of entropy and speculated about a possible relationship with living systems. Ludwig Boltzmann and Erwin Schrödinger developed the idea further. Boltzmann wrote: “The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials – these, for organisms, are air, water, and soil, all abundantly available – not for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a struggle for [negative] entropy, which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth.” Schrödinger explained in his book What Is Life? that life, being an open system, decreases or maintains entropy levels by feeding on free energy. At some age, all organisms decline and die even though nutrients abound; during its lifespan, life avoids decay by sustaining a highly ordered state at the expense of a net increase of disorder in the environment. Living structures are products of assembly and decay, and they are batteries of free energy. The universe itself isn’t a closed system as Julian Barbour points out. The Poincaré recurrence theorem therefore doesn’t apply. In an expanding universe, time is a measure for increasing complexity in the system. The expanding universe is not time-translation invariant, and energy is not conserved. The wavelength of light will increase as universe expands because it stretches. The energy which is inversely proportional to wavelength will decrease. Intensities will diminish, but ratios remain unaffected—there is always meaning in ratios. </p>
        <p>Indeed, the English word reason is borrowed from the Latin word ratio, proportion. A ratio is an analogy, ‘this to that like this to that’. Hume states that all our reasonings are founded on ‘a species of analogy’. All physical units are arbitrary; meaning can only be obtained from relationships between those units. Barbour considers the universe a succession of shapes. Our brains are shaped to interpret those shapes. The intensity of sensory perception is logarithmic and forms observed by the human eye have no absolute sizes but are evaluated against their surroundings. David Bohm observes, “a map is said to correspond to a city, but there is nothing on the map that corresponds to anything in the city. On the map you see dots of print. What corresponds are certain abstractions”. These certain abstractions agree in their internal relationships. </p>

        <p>We need to devise a framework that adequately represents the shape-based nature of perception and thought taking into account the particularities and peculiarities of time. Minkowski space, which combines three-dimensional Euclidian space and time, seems a suitable starting point. World points can lie inside or outside the observer’s body. The worldline is the observer’s trajectory through space and time. The observer is located where his worldline intersects the present plane. The present plane separates the future from the past and in our case possesses a certain thickness to account for the viscous perception of the present moment. Sensory impressions take place in the present plane. Much like the past and the future light cone, there is a trove of past (assumed) and future (expected) events along the world line of which the observer could gain knowledge of and interact with. We will call it field of consciousness, or FOC for short. </p>
        <p>“Nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets,” wrote David Hume. We can only perceive superficial sensory qualities; natures underlying forces are sealed from us. In this regard, arguments among gestaltists and empiricists are merely a matter of degree, as organisms never sense the ‘raw data’. Everything we do observe are projections of this raw data. The projection varies sharply from species to species as; all animals perceive their environment in a different manner. “A blind man can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense, in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in conceiving these objects”, notes Hume. Jakob von Uexküll coined the term umwelt for the organism’s perceptual world. In fact, there cannot be a neutral species-unspecific reference frame. Vice-versa, there cannot be any species-specific manifestations without a living organism around. According to Galileo’s sensory philosophy, there can only be ‘vibrations in the air but no sound’, if a tree falls in the forest but no witness is close enough to give testimony.</p>
        <p>In summary, all perception is projection of the underlying order. This concept is comparable to David Bohm’s term of the implicit order that becomes explicit in the present moment. It is also closely related to the semiotics of Charles Sanders Pierce; the big difference being, that in our case the object on its own is a sign itself. For Pierce, a sign is anything that communicates a meaning to the interpreter that is not the sign itself. “All this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs,” said Pierce. Semiosis takes place in the here-now of our time-space framework and more complex signs demand a longer internal present (the thickness of the present plane). Not every sign is equally well suited and the organism must learn to distinguish the good ones from the bad ones; Egon Brunswik’s ‘ecological validity’ offers a solution to describe a cue's informativeness. Thomas Sebeok suspected that the presence of semiotic sign exchange would serve as an indicator whether as system is alive or not: “The phenomenon that distinguishes life forms from inanimate objects is semiosis”. In our framework, this definition roughly translates into a FOC strictly larger than zero. A FOC horizon larger than zero also means that an organism is conscious of its environment in a primitive sense. Depth of FOC horizon (especially time horizon) might even be a measure of consciousness.</p>
        <p>Von Uexküll proposed that even a single cell operates its own functional cycle. He writes: “We are forced to attribute an umwelt, however limited, to the amoeba, an umwelt common to each of them, in which the bacteria contrast with their surroundings, as meaning-carriers, as food, and, in doing so, are perceived and acted upon.” All life thus evolves around the interpretation of signs. Since no organism perceives single atoms or sub-atomic units, even the simplest sign by default consists of a larger configuration. Gestalt psychology is concerned with principles of grouping in human perception. Classical laws comprise proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, and parallelism. Later, synchrony, common region, element connectedness, and past experience were added to that list. The plethora of laws called for a simplification of principles. Two such general explanations were found: the simplicity principle (prägnanz), which holds that perceptions are structured into the simplest organizations possible, and the likelihood principle, which holds that percepts are structured to conform to the most likely stimulus that could have given rise to the sensory information. At first glance, simplicity principle and likelihood principle seem to be at odds with one another, but Ray Solomonoff showed that the simplest hypothesis tends to be the most stable and consequently the most frequent. </p>
        <p>Pierce came to the conclusion that all thought is in signs. Instead of signs, ‘event pattern’ will be our choice of words because it is the most neutral of all. ‘Sign’ colloquially references any pointer that is not the object itself; ‘shape’, the preferred term used by the gestaltists, puts too much emphasis on the contour or silhouette of the object. Pattern, on the other hand, is more inclusive; it can denote anything from texture, temperature, color, scent, sound, movement patterns, and so on. We will need this versatility because many of gestaltists’ laws apply similarly in much broader terms. Event patterns are infinitely nested in a fractal-like manner; much like the visible or audible spectrum, a natural bandwidth exists that holds the information appropriate to the organism. For our own species, we will call this bandwidth the human scale. The relevant fraction of this scale is contextually determined by the current situation—the relative position of the observer in respect to the object; compare for example: pupil, iris, eye, face, head, body, group of people… a grain of sand, a brick, a wall, a building, a street, a city… leaf, branch, tree, forest, or territory… The only race that artificially extended breadth and depth of its perceptual scale are humans. Technological means allow us to amplify existing senses (microscopes, telescopes, hearing aids) or tap into new sensory streams altogether (radar, sonar, ultrasound, x-rays, thermal imaging, etc.) which are then consumed by biological senses. </p>

        <p>The idea that perception is not pure in a sense of complete and infallible upward stream from the receptor organs to the brain is not new. Ibn al-Haytham conjectured a thousand years ago that vision occurs in the brain and not in the eyes. Focusing on the relationship of sense and the external environment, Galileo Galilei too, was aware of potentially deceptive appearances that could lead to fallacies in perception and limit our understanding of the world. In his 1867 Treatise on Physiological Optics, Hermann von Helmholtz discussed a reflex-like, unconscious, and involuntary inference which is part of the formation of visual impressions. Those unconscious judgments are so impervious to conscious control that they are “impossible to get rid of”. The quickness it occurs makes it impossible to account for just how we arrived at the final judgment. David Hume illustrates, “the imagination conceives the simple object at once, with facility, by a single effort of thought, without change or variation. The connexion of parts in the compound object has almost the same effect, and so unites the object within itself, that the fancy feels not the transition in passing from one part to another. Hence the colour, taste, figure, solidity, and other qualities, combin'd in a peach or melon, are conceiv'd to form one thing”. </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-portrait" src="images\aoth-vision.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>For closer examination, we can split Helmholtzian inference into three conceptual steps. Firstly, the organism detects and delimits (‘snatches’) an event pattern at least partially from its surroundings. Secondly, the pattern is ‘matched’ against previous experiences of similar attributes. Thirdly, the original impression is completed (‘patched’) by those previous experiences. Of course, we will find that this separation can only serve as a thought experiment. In reality, step two is basically sealed in a black box, except for rare circumstances in which we can get a glimpse of its working magic. Meanwhile steps one and three are heavily interwoven and almost impossible to tell apart: What is delimited and what catches our eye in the first place is largely determined by our experience (step three) before the cycle even starts; if you spot a sink, you know will look for the tap next, etc. </p>
        <p>The German word for reason, Vernunft, is derived from the word ‘perceived’. And, beyond any doubt, our mental skills are intimately linked to sensory perception. Senses developed to detect change. Change can be static—a red flower in a green field—or it can be a function of time and motion; either because the observer moves or because elements in the environment move (in the case of static change, it’s the eyes that move). Time, or more generally the sequence of events, gives rise to perception. When you hold an object in your hands for a prolonged period of time, you might forget its presence altogether; when you enter a noisy, dark, or smelly room, you will eventually adapt to the new surroundings. Perception is relative; fifteen degrees Celsius will feel warm in spring and cold in autumn. What used to call your attention becomes the new normal. </p>
        <p>Today in a Bayesian world, ‘surprise’ is the word preferred; but taking a step back, surprise, change, order, gestalt, structure, and salience all boil down to denote roughly the same thing in a world bound for equilibrium and chaos. In a setting that is completely leveled out there would be no red spots, no heat sources, no well-defined shapes, or motion. It would be a grey, uniform soup in which particles have no reason to move because there are no differences. Thus, if those well-defined shapes achieve to emerge, it is indeed cause for surprise. They are storage structures of free energy and organisms are well-advised to be able to spot them. Since surprise is relative and highly subjective, it is very difficult to measure it beyond broader gestalt principles. What is new information to one organism is old news to another, or to the same organism further down the road. It depends on its history, the worldline of the observer. Life is a repeated game and experience plays an important role; revisiting a scene is like repainting a wall. Those gaps that were spared in the first run are filled during the second round. Because salient events of the first round are demoted and objects of lesser absolute salience have a chance to move up. Other times, it’s quite the opposite; an apparently inconspicuous feature jumps into attention because experience tells us that it’s important—we knew what to look for.</p>
        <p>The organism absorbs a constant stream of impressions along all sensory axis. Cross-sensory inputs are simultaneous by nature. Sequential impressions are perceived quasi-simultaneously. I can see the tree beside the house but I can only focus on either one of them at a time; only one tone at a time hits the eardrum and still it is perceived as a coherent word or melody as in Christian von Ehrenfels’ case. Compacity of world points within a single event pattern is crucial. David Bohm says that “at a given moment a certain note is being played but a number of the previous notes are still ‘reverberating’ in consciousness. Close attention will show that it’s the simultaneous presence and activity of all these reverberations that is responsible for the direct and immediately felt sense of movement, flow and continuity. The main difference between music and visual images, in this regard, is that the latter may arrive so close together in time that they cannot be resolved in consciousness. Nevertheless, it is clear that visual images must also undergo active transformation as they ‘enfold’ into the brain.”</p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-landscape" src="images\aoth-present.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Event patterns must be snatched and delimited. While this process seems trivial, it usually is not. Listening to a foreign language can sound as an uninterrupted, unintelligible stream of gibberish. Only with time, words emerge and things begin to make sense. A scene is the entirety of world points that can be contemplated from the here-now. Just like the present plane, a scene always has a certain temporal depth; for sensory inputs (‘snatched’ events), this is the working memory. Within a scene, event points are constantly—consciously and subconsciously—written on the same page of life; they are ‘compaginated’. We will refer to concurrent events in the same present plane as horizontal, and subsequent events along the worldline as vertically connected. This compagination takes place within the event pattern and beyond its limits. In the end, all event patterns are fractally weaved and nested into each other, where the scene is simply the mother of those patterns. For convenience, we will call the event pattern currently in focus the event core, and the remaining scene the event bleed. Charles Sanders Peirce wrote: “To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system.” Therefore, the event core represents the denotation of the event pattern, whereas the event bleed holds its connotation. </p>
        <p>For further convenience, we can group all alike-shaped patterns together in the so-called event stack. This is a crude simplification for several reasons; events can be grouped along an infinite number of criteria, and no two event patterns are exactly the same: Environmental conditions can change, or the relative position between observer and object. Even the unobservable object in event space undergoes changes. In the spirit of Kurt Lewin’s genidentity, we don’t consider two objects identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. No two observations are the same; every event is a metaphor for another closely related event. Being aware of those limitations, we can use our newly created concept of the event stack to track the movements of mind. The corresponding event bleeds of all grouped events are combined in the stack bleed. The stack bleed contains the accumulated connotation of the observed event. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Reason is a derivative of the Latin word ratio, proportion, or relation. It is the faculty of the mind to detect those relations and contrast them in meaningful ways with other previously observed relational structures. There is no meaning without context. Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it. A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e., it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist. Relations are not secondary to what a thing is; they are what the thing is. The event’s information arises from its connections with the environment in the present situation and in any situation before. The fittest brain is the one that detects the most relevant pattern and matches it with the most befitting experience in memory. While only one (top-level) pattern is in focus in any given here now, immeasurably more (lower-level) patterns are observed (quasi-) simultaneously; contemplating the sea, the shades of blue, reflections, water currents, the sound of the waves, and so on, are event patterns in their own right that are also ‘snatched’ by the organism with their very own relationships and associations. </p>
        <p>Different authors came to different counts of the principles of association. Aristotle named four, Hume counted three—resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect—while John Stuart Mill boiled them down to just two. To him, ideas or sensations which are either (i) “similar” or (ii) “frequently experienced (or thought of) either simultaneously or in immediate succession”, come to be thought of together, and are eventually inseparably bound together in our mind, forming more complex ideas. Hume finds “a secret tie or union among particular ideas, which causes the mind to conjoin them more frequently, and make the one, upon its appearance, introduce the other.” Similarity and contiguity can be mapped to two mental processes in our stack analogy, jump and roll, and finally just one. Jumps are movements within the stack core; one event pattern takes us to another alike-shaped pattern. We ‘jump’ because we don’t touch the event space in between; we fly blind like we do during an elevator ride. Unaware of the distance travelled, we only know that both stops share a floor opening of equal dimensions to which the cabin doors attach. The second operation is between the stack core and its bleed. If jumping are stops along the elevator shaft, then rolling are the hallways that connect the various rooms. This time, we are capable of observing the event space in between if we pay attention. Jump and roll is a convenient interpretation that fits human perception. If we abstract even further, and read the scene as all-encompassing mother pattern, we are left with a single operation—jump: we get from one state to the next following the path of highest overlap. At closer inspection, the lines between jump and roll—similarity and contiguity—are not clear cut: When I walk around a statue, front and back have little in common, yet I’m talking about the same object. Breaking down my walk on the arc around the statue into infinitesimal small steps, the viewing angle, and hence the event pattern, changes constantly. At the limit, contiguity and similarity become indistinguishable. If our conjecture is valid, a simple Rule of Relevance (overlap) would govern intelligent life. </p>
        <p>Stuart Kauffman rightfully expressed doubt whether we would ever be capable of predicting the development of a biological system. Yet, some future states arise more easily than others; a circumstance that he calls the ‘adjacent possible’. Life senses how the world unfolds as no future event will be exactly identical to any past event. Unlike a computer that interprets the world in black-and-white terms. Fuzziness is a built-in feature; close enough is good enough. Better is possible, but does not always make sense from an evolutionary perspective. Bertrand Russell tells the story of the farmer who feeds the chicken day in and day out, and at last wrings its neck instead. A more complex world view would have benefitted the individual chicken, but on populational level, a chicken brain just does the trick. Lately, human intervention made it harder for nature to keep up. Close enough was suddenly no longer good enough; that’s why we find fish and bird stomachs filled with plastic parts. Floating trash simply matches the pattern and nature was left no time to refine it. By fallibilism, Peirce meant the view that “people cannot attain absolute certainty concerning questions of fact.” Fallibilism doesn’t imply that we have no knowledge; fallibilists typically only deny that knowledge requires absolute certainty. They accept that many beliefs can be considered certain beyond reasonable doubt and therefore acted upon, allowing us to live functional and meaningful lives. Any of the things we take as empirical knowledge might turn out to be false and can be revised by further observation. </p>

        <p>After being snatched as event-space projection, matched against previous experiences, sensory perception and mental image are merged in a final step. In a sense, memory ‘patches’ an incomplete account of the external world. John Stuart Mill remarks: “We may fancy that we see or feel what we in reality infer. A truth, or supposed truth, which is really the result of a very rapid inference, may seem to be apprehended intuitively. […] A great part of what seems observation is really inference. […] For in almost every act of our perceiving faculties, observation and inferences are intimately blended. What we are said to observe is usually a compound result, of which one-tenth may be observation, and the remaining nine-tenths inference.” He goes on, “Place, Extension, Substance, Cause, and the rest, are conceptions put together out of ideas of sensation by the known laws of association”.</p>
        <p>This patch comes essentially in two flavors, although the line between them is blurry and the underlying matching mechanism is the same. The distinction is arbitrary and shall serve to elaborate the origin of knowledge and understanding. We will label them with the popular terms ‘virtual reality’ (VR) and ‘augmented reality’ (AR), since they are well-fitted to capture the essence of both. The main differentiator of both is time. The former is the like of Sperling’s iconic memory, a buffer of the immediately experienced past. ‘Virtual reality’ bestows thickness to present moment and allows us to perceive time as a sticky fluid rather than discrete drops. Senses can only focus on a single instance at a time, yet the scene appears as a coherent whole. VR fills in the pattern core. The second kind, ‘augmented reality’, is then concerned with understanding and interpreting the perceived present. AR completes the pattern bleed. Not knowing is like not seeing. This becomes obvious when looking at foreign writing. The impression remains superficial, nothing more than pigments on a sheet. Familiar signs render deep, immediate insights and evoke a trove of associated moods. This seems little surprising, since linguistic systems are among the most advanced features of human perception. But the relationship is also true for the most basic interpretations of the environment. Toddlers grasp for highlights and shadows on the floor because they haven’t learned to ‘read’ three-dimensionality, the subtleties of shadings and gradients that allow an adult person to make the right judgement. Hilda Oakeley speaks of ‘creative memory’, the process by which experiences are interwoven into the present. As one finding of ‘The World as Memory and as History’—a child, an adult, a fisherman, a scientist—all will see something different looking at a fish tank. Indeed, no two observers experience the current moment exactly the same way because they do not share the same worldline. Generally, as the organism matures, its life space becomes more differentiated, as Kurt Lewin concludes. </p>
        <p>Empiricists like Hume and Mill claim that we cannot know anything of objects in themselves, but only as they appear to us. The world view is established by appealing to what we are warranted in believing about the nature of those objects—and hence relies on a substantive account of knowledge. Hume’s central empirical axiom is known as the Copy Principle, which states that all constituents of thought are obtained from experience. To John Stuart Mill, sense perceptions are the “original data, or ultimate premises of our knowledge”. All ideas are product of sensory impressions; knowledge of greater levels of complexity is arrived at solely by inferences from that original data. They can be shuffled, altered, and compounded, but in the end, they can always be traced back to sensory information. A blind man cannot form a notion of color according to Hume, and if you want a child explain the taste of a pineapple, you give her one to taste. In fact, the term imagination comes from the word ‘imago’, an image or likeness, which derives from the stem ‘imitari’, to copy or imitate. A thought is the past carried forward into the present, says David Bohm.</p>
        <p>Of the three natural associative relations, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect, Hume considers latter the most consequential and devotes extensive research to it: Causation alone allows us to go “beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory”. It becomes immediately obvious how his analysis shall be of great value to our event-space framework, in which the present plane separates the past from the future and the intersection of worldline and present plane mark the location of the observer. Unlike Hume, we make no distinction between consecutive and concurrent event points. While one contributes depth to understanding, the other contributes breadth. Hume was convinced that reason cannot establish the grounds of causation; instead, the mind imputes causality after repeatedly observing a connection between two bodies—or, to be more general, two event patterns. </p>
        <p>Both, David Hume and John Stuart Mill, center the discussion around the problem of induction. Hume holds that “that there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove, that those instances, of which we have had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience. We can at least conceive a change in the course of nature; which sufficiently proves, that such a change is not absolutely impossible. To form a clear idea of any thing, is an undeniable argument for its possibility, and is alone a refutation of any pretended demonstration against it.” He discards deductive reasoning because it falls short at underpinning the uniformity of nature. Mill on his part, comes to the conclusion that we cannot acquire any genuinely new knowledge a priori. “Inference, consequently all Proof, and all discovery of truths not self-evident, consists of inductions, and the interpretation of inductions. […] Nothing ever was, or can be proved by syllogism which was not known, or assumed to be known, before.” We are sharpening inductive reasoning by “ulterior revision of […] spontaneous generalizations.” This enumerative induction is the sole principle by which we are justified in inferring unobserved facts about the world, according to Mill, and stands at the heart of the process of scientific thinking. Mill devises five methods of induction: the methods of agreement, difference, residue, concomitant variation, and the joint method of agreement and difference. </p>
        <p>Every time we use deductive inferences, any such knowledge rests on previous inductive reasoning, even if we are no longer aware of it. The formula for the area enclosed by a circle or the Pythagorean Theorem, which we take as given, all once were established by—often graphical—trial and error. Arithmetic operations are founded in moving and counting real objects. Fundamental laws are later subsumed as the science of numbers grows more sophisticated. This sort of subsumption is a special case of a broader principle which Mill refers to as the Law of Obliviscence. It states that when a number of ideas suggest one another by association with such certainty and rapidity as to coalesce together in a group, all those members of the group which remain long without being specially attended to, have a tendency to drop out of consciousness. In this framework we will make ample use of the process of habit formation. To Hume and Mill, “knowledge begins with the parts, and not with the whole.” John Stuart Mill wrote in defense of his father: “After reading a chapter of a book, when we lay down the volume, we do not retain any impression of the separate letters and syllables. […] Yet each of these letters and syllables must have been present to us as a sensation for at least a passing moment.” At this point we must conciliate the gestaltists’ stance, that, once learned, the whole is indeed perceived—patched—before the individual constituents are read out—snatched. The word pattern is recognized before each letter is diligently observed, just as the letter pattern is recognized before every drop of ink is dutifully examined. Only when learning a new word, we need to carefully examine every letter before habit banishes them into obliviscence. Thus, the empiricist concept of habit allows us to skip the parts and observe the whole before its constituents in a gestaltian manner. </p>

        <p>At the same time, Hume is concerned to show the importance of probable reasoning by establishing induction as the very grounds for attributing causation. This carries serious implications: While deductive logic allows us to arrive at a conclusion with certainty, inductive logic can only provide conclusions that are probably true. This at least is a widely acknowledged distinction between the two; according to our interpretation, demonstrative arguments are simply a very distilled form of probable arguments, and as such demand for additional qualifiers as the field under consideration grows: For short distances, the world still can be considered flat; and in many everyday situations, classical physics still ‘gets the job done’. </p>
        <p>Edmund Husserl derived from Weierstrass the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. Intuitionism, founded by L.E.J. Brouwer, goes further and considers mathematics to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles in a very Humean spirit. If numbers are finite and limited in their precision, then nature itself is inherently imprecise, and thus unpredictable. Deterministic predictions are fundamentally impossible in general in a Kauffmanian sense. It’s a creative unfolding as proposed by Julian Barbour. New information is coming into being and is most likely also subject to decay. When intuitionist math is used to describe the evolution of physical systems, it makes clear, that time really passes. In Brouwer’s framework, statements about numbers might be neither true nor false at a given time, since the number’s exact value hasn’t yet revealed itself. Numbers cannot be properly divided into positive and negative set. A yet-to-be-created number x sits right at knife’s edge, not falling into either basket, neither past nor future. This sticky continuum translates directly into our perception that the present is thick, according to Nicolas Gisin.</p>
        <p>Like deductive logic, inductive logic is equally incapable to attest the uniformity of nature. All probable reasoning “proceed upon the supposition, that the future will be conformable to the past. […] ’Tis impossible for us to satisfy ourselves by our reason, why we shou’d extend that experience beyond those particular instances, which have fallen under our observation”. People commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate. Over repeated observation, one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes. However, the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction. Apart from this conceptual shortcoming, probable reasoning is plagued by a more profane flaw: The mind can always conceive any effect to follow from any cause since we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. </p>
        <p>Hume argues, that humans invent the notion of probability and chance because they cannot actually determine precisely how things will happen. These probabilities are formed by habit and experience rather than by understanding. “Since it appears, that the transition from an impression present to the memory or senses to the idea of an object, which we call cause or effect, is founded on past experience, and on our remembrance of their constant conjunction, the next question is, whether experience produces the idea by means of the understanding or imagination; whether we are determin'd by reason to make the transition, or by a certain association and relation of perceptions. If reason determin'd us, it wou'd proceed upon that principle, that instances, of which we have had no experience, must resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the course of nature continues always uniformly the same. […] Probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance betwixt those objects, of which we have had experience, and those, of which we have had none; and therefore, 'tis impossible this presumption can arise from probability. The same principle cannot be both the cause and effect of another; and this is, perhaps, the only proposition concerning that relation, which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain.”</p>
        <p>Given that reason alone cannot be sufficient to establish the grounds of induction, Hume implies that induction must be accomplished through imagination. Habit leads to belief and we rightfully follow our beliefs. It is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. Hume considers that “nature, by an absolute and uncontrollable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel.” To him, it is far better to rely on “the ordinary wisdom of nature”, which ensures that we form beliefs “by some instinct or mechanical tendency”, rather than trusting it to “the fallacious deductions of our reason”. Since “without the influence of custom, we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses.” Beliefs are shaped in a way that they “makes us expect for the future”; “a kind of pre-established harmony” is created “between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas”. This natural instinct which we share with the animal world may in fact be more effective in making us successful in the world, than if we relied on reason. We are warranted to heed our instincts because it is the rational thing to do to accept that we are part of nature. </p>
        <p>“Probability, as it discovers not the relations of ideas, consider'd as such, but only those of objects, must in some respects be founded on the impressions of our memory and senses, and in some respects on our ideas. Were there no mixture of any impression in our probable reasonings, the conclusion wou'd be entirely chimerical: And were there no mixture of ideas, the action of the mind, in observing the relation, wou'd, properly speaking, be sensation, not reasoning. 'Tis therefore necessary, that in all probable reasonings there be something present to the mind, either seen or remember'd; and that from this we infer something connected with it, which is not seen nor remember'd.” In other words, every conscious observation is a blend state of snatch and patch. There can be neither pure sensory perception nor pure memory. This observation conduces us to the Inadequacy Principles: (i) A snatch can never capture the entire scene, and (ii) A patch can never be a full description of a scene. Or, in Hume’s words: “I observe, that many of our complex ideas never had impressions, that corresponded to them, and that many of our complex impressions never are exactly copied in ideas.”</p>

        </figure>
        <p>After examining the empiricist side of the coin, we shall turn our attention to gestalt psychology and see how it relates to Hume’s imagination. The key principles of gestalt systems are reification, emergence, multistability, and invariance. Reification loosely translates to ‘thing-making’; the elevation of something abstract into something concrete. It is the creative process by which perception yields more spatial information than sensory information actually provides. It is closely related to the second property, emergence. The smiley-face ideogram :-) would be one example for emergence. We see a face before we see a colon and a bracket. Thus, the whole is perceived before its integral parts; meaning emerges from the relative position of induvial worldpoints to each other. The face perception does not work if it’s out of proportion, if one fragment is located at the opposite end of the row than the other, or if font size varies considerably. We can see how this sort of structuring and grouping into larger patterns relates to the concept of obliviscence and the subsummation of more rudimentary information. The final emergent property is the patch—served up from memory—which kicks in as soon as gathered—snatched—information meets a certain threshold to make an educated guess. The underlying mechanism doesn’t change whether it is intra-pattern or extra-pattern. Why should it and where should be drawn the line? Delimitations are very much arbitrary. We have seen earlier, that patterns are recursively nested; the colon in the smiley face is container and constituent at the same time. The brain will simply deliver the largest pattern that still makes sense. The relation between elements will decide what something represents; the difference between a smiley face and a sad face is subtle. There is no pattern without context and all meaning is derived from context. Patching is what we usually refer to as recognition. As a matter of fact, every patch is an aha moment; the majority are simply negligibly small. </p>

          </div>
        </figure>
        <p>The next gestalt property to consider is multistability. Multistability leads to ambiguous images that can be read in different ways. The patch is rendered according the relevance principle, that selects the match with the biggest overlap within the frame of the snatched scene. Multistability occurs at the tipping point when no clear winner can be made out. In this case, small changes like viewing angle, temporal sequence serve up a different patch. Multistability is nothing more and nothing less than the decision-making process in action. If we scale the focus pattern to the level of the entire scene, we find ourselves in a position of constantly changing tipping points due to permanently changing subcomponents within the frame. Researchers found exactly this sort of behavior for rats in a maze; the mice literally juggled alternative futures while approaching a fork. We can speculate that the final decision, other things being equal, might be up to chance. It might come down to whether the mouse puts down the right or the left foot when it reaches the intersection because this movement has been associated with said decision. Figure-ground organization can then be considered a special case of multistability. Figure-ground ambiguity makes it possible that two adjacent regions can be perceived as a mosaic whole or as separated into foreground and background. </p>
        <p>The last gestalt principle, invariance, concerns the recognition of shapes as the same object regardless of viewing angle, deformations and the like. Hume counts seven distinct mental operations that contribute to human imagination and creativity: compounding, transposing, augmenting, diminishing, mixing, separating, and dividing. Other geometric concepts, such as rotating, flipping, mirroring, skewing, nesting, unwrapping etc. are missing from his list. We should further include further visual manipulations like contrast, brightness, saturation, or the speed and timing of dynamic patterns, and similar operations for other sensory streams, especially for the perception of sound—loudness, pitch, duration, clarity, timbre, or spatial location. Applying Hume’s Copy Principle, invariance can then be interpreted as the playback of formerly recorded episodes. The brain captures scenes like a camera that dollies, trucks, pans, or tilts. Once a like-shaped dynamic pattern enters the mind, those associated strings are then ‘played back’ before our inner eyes. Indeed, we are much better at mentally scaling an object than at rotating in three-dimensional space—most likely because we spend little time spinning on our heads or juggling furniture. Looking at pictures, we have a hard time recognizing even familiar faces if we look at them upside-down from the other side of the table. </p>
        <p>Now we can easily see how reification and invariance can come together to aid the organism in everyday problem-solving tasks. It is almost like virtual puzzle solving or Tetris where fitting pieces cling to each other, one ‘thought’ ushering in the next, with many intermediate steps subsumed in a Millian manner. A larger structure latching on to another larger structure leads to a resolution, a ‘tetris’, an idea. The aha-moment catapults the thought to center of attention. The basic logical links are ‘with this that’, ‘from this that’, and ‘this like that’. This algorithm is best explained in terms of language (but identical for all nonverbal properties) and works as follows: Let’s take two sets {A, B, C, D} and {A, B, C, X}. Hence, all members A, B, C map to a perfect counterpart in the second set. If furthermore the internal relationships are the same, e.g. A-B, C-D and A-B, C-X respectively, then it’s likely that D maps to X, too. In other words, the mind fills in the unknown puzzle part X. Memorizing utilizes the same mechanism. The observer in t1 wants to remember fact X in t2. He knows that he is at {A, B, C} at t2; that is, he will ‘pre-pair’ {A, B, C, X} in t1 and will hope that the observation of either element A, B, or C will trigger X when encountered. Likewise, an observer in t2 who wants to remember fact X from t1 will try to remember as many accompanying facts {A, B, C} from t1 as possible, or, even better, place himself in the same surrounding again. The same for a person that tries not to forget a dream after waking up. She will try to change as little as possible of the compaginated facts A, B, C of dream X, where A might refer to the body position, B emotional state, C the condition of the room. Once she turns on the light or gets up, newly snatched data is likely to overwrite any of the scene components, reducing the match overlap and diminishing the chances to recall X. </p>

          <img class="figure-landscape" src="images\aoth-puzzle.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Despite constant criticism, associationist theories never completely disappeared. In this section we want to address some of the most common concerns. Hume himself, was his first critic and left wondering about ‘missing shade of blue’. We saw that saturation and luminance are just additional variables on which the brain can perform ‘rational’ (as in ratio) operations; that is, it can interpolate values and ‘apply proportions’ (‘mixes’, in Hume’s terms): “unknown shade X to color A as known shade Y to color B”. The adult brain has plenty of ‘experiences’ where different shades are compaginated concurrently (lights falling off on a curved hill side) or subsequently (dusk and dawn). The most common outside criticism concerns the necessity of repeated observation. “There is a secret tie or union among particular ideas, which causes the mind to conjoin them more frequently, and makes the one, upon its appearance, introduce the other.” Critics object with the observation of fast-mapping and one-shot learning. Counter-critics draw into question long-term retention of such associations. From the standpoint of this framework, we can consider two factors which might be involved. Firstly, not all instances of time are made the same. Perception is always a blend state of snatch and patch. This is commonly referred to as attention. Moments of a higher snatch-patch ratio (SPR) ‘count more’. Secondly, we must consider pattern specificity. The organism is more likely to recall event X in T2 if remaining events from T1, {A, B, C, D}, are present too, where A might represent the interviewer, B the room, C background noise, and D the emotional state of the subject. The length of the set itself might intervene favorably or unfavorably. In a short set (a blank room) there is little confusion which eliminates the need for multiple exposures to the object in varying contexts to eliminate uncertainty. On the other hand, there are less ‘handles’ to retrieve its content in the future. Set length and content are also related to the question of what will be learned (credit-assignment problem). Without knowing the full background (worldline) of the organism there can be no certainty about which scene event it will relate to since snatching is also a function of the patch. Constructivists like Jean Piaget argue that knowledge can only build upon structures which already have been formed and the preexisting basis shapes the way new input is assimilated. </p>
        <p>Other complaints regard phenomenon of propositions and predication among associated concepts. Pure associationists held that associations should be neutral and unbiased. We can see that this expectation is hard to fulfill even on day one of the organism’s lifetime due to the nested nature of event patterns. This is where gestaltist were right, and empiricists were wrong; we are not dealing with isolated elements but a connected whole. There is no information in isolation. Thus, if subjects are presented with word pairs such as ‘bird/flies’, ‘birds/fly’, ‘bird/fly’, ‘birds/flies’ there is already plenty of background knowledge involved. The final ‘s’ implicitly signals person and number. They have already been associated in the past. The presented pairings are therefore not pure associations but ‘structs’; a struct is a nested association in which at least one member is an association itself. Even grammatically unsuspicious terms as Köhler’s ‘baluba’ and ‘takete’ are laden with associations. The British empiricists were aware that associations were not easily translated in time; ‘salt and …’ more readily produces ‘pepper’ than the other way around. The same way, we do not understand words spoken backwards. The record can only be ‘played back’ (patched) as recorded. </p>
        <p>Other criticisms regarding purist ideals of associationism are the overrepresentation of nouns in children’s vocabulary and domain generality. Critics expect verbs, adjectives and so on to be equally present in the word stock of learners according to their frequency in daily usage. Yet, anybody who has ever learned a foreign language is fully aware that overrepresentation is common not only for newborns but adults as well. It is so much easier to attach a new word to a concrete object than to an abstract concept. This of course, doesn’t not undermine the validity of associationism, rather the opposite—we link the sound to the designated event pattern. And this pattern is much easier delimitable if it is a physical object. Domain generality is the assumptions that compaginations should be neutral across sensory streams, but in reality, some senses work better together more efficiently. From an evolutionary point of view, this shouldn’t come as a surprise at all. We can easily conceive situations in which certain event-stream pairings happen to be more frequent than others and the brain’s preference is a response to these conditions. The last argument we look at is the blocking of a newly-to-be-learned association by another existing association. We could speculate that the organism is on high alert in an unknown environment. Snatching has the upper hand as long as the unpatched state prevails. Attention drops once the first patch is served and the organism enters a complacent state. This argumentation is roughly in line with the Zeigarnik Effect. </p>

        <h4 id="section2">Section 2: Out of Proportion</h4>
        <p>The mind is full of quirks and glitches. Every theory resting on the assumption of rationality is doomed to hit a wall rather sooner than later. Hume’s approach on the other hand proves astonishingly resilient and flexible in accommodating any sort of malalignment. In his accounts, Helmholtz gives two examples of how easily and convincingly the human mind is tricked into believing what is not. The first depiction is that of the illusion of the sun rotating around the earth: “Every evening apparently before our eyes the sun goes down behind the stationary horizon, although we are well aware that the sun is fixed and the horizon moves.” His second example refers to theatrical performance, arguing that the strong emotional effect of a play results mainly from the viewers' inability to doubt the visual impressions generated by unconscious inference: “An actor who cleverly portrays an old man is for us an old man there on the stage, so long as we let the immediate impression sway us, and do not forcibly recall that the program states that the person moving about there is the young actor with whom we are acquainted.”</p>
        <p>While optical illusions are the most obvious instances of unconscious inference, people's perceptions of each other are similarly influenced by such unintended, unconscious conclusions. Agents produce an emotional attitude without any reasonable basis whatsoever, yet highly resilient against all rational criticism. We can group behavioral biases around a limited number of ‘grand themes’. The first group contains distortions related to salience of patterns, inertias, attachments, repulsions and attractions to them, as well as bleed-in effects (priming, spill-over, fill-in) among them. The second group holds inference-related distortions: the rendering of false response patterns and connections, the amalgamation of memory and imagination, perspective and time-related misrepresentations, aspects of proportion, ratio, size and importance, and lastly the observer’s ego-centric filter. This framework founded on association and gestalt principles which places the observer at the heart of the event space (the here-now) looks a priori well-suited to accommodate many of those mishaps of thought. </p>
        <p>Let’s look at a random selection of oddities, not necessarily the most puzzling ones but peculiar and entertaining in their own right, to see how they fit into the picture of this framework. Magicians and pickpockets have exploited the shortcomings of perception for millennia. A lack of understanding of the mind’s workings didn’t prevent them from skillfully targeting its weak spots. The art of conjuring and deception lies not so much in the act itself but in influencing the perception of the spectator; it has been called ‘a manipulation of interest’. Misdirection rests on the limitations of perception. While the response (patch) is infinitely fast, the information intake (snatch) is not. Energy needs vary widely, too. While attentive observation is exhausting, patching comes almost at zero energetic cost. While the brain scans the environment one element at the time, the rest of the scene is hold together by memory (virtual reality) and provided with meaning (augmented reality). This lag causes a mismatch between the internal and the external state to which many of the following observations can be attributed. While attention focuses on a specific part of the scene, ‘inertia’ makes it fly blind in the remaining part. Thus, the conjurer must create a more salient pattern for the time necessary. In a famous scene of inattentional blindness, a gorilla enters a group of moving people with some delay. Once the scene has been patched, curiosity and attention of the observer drop to release memory. Previously observed information has been bundled into the largest sensible struct possible according gestalt principles. In this case, ‘a group of dancing people’ and no longer ‘person x doing y, wearing z’ for each participant. </p>
        <p>Illusions and (pseudo)hallucinations are another distortion happening in the snatch-patch process. A toddler’s vision develops from blurry shades to sharp contours over the course of months; similarly, perception assembles when it comes into contact with a new impression aided by learned associations turned into structs, just infinitely fast. As the image crystallizes and takes shape, interpretation updates too in accordance with the Relevance Rule as certain thresholds are reached. That is, changing ‘augmented reality’ is served up. Under usual conditions, this match is a one-hit. Only under unfavorable internal or external conditions, the process is slowed down and laid bare for us to observe. Darkness or fog might grind the rendering process to a halt on the outside, and substance abuse slows signal processing on the inside. These situations leave the task of snatching incomplete raising the matching ambiguity. Even under otherwise favorable circumstances, the lag can be appreciated. The flashed-face illusion turns regular people into zombies as the brain mends the gaps between snatched parts of the image. Sensory perception occurs across multiple layers (outline, color, heat, texture…). Apophenic illusions happen to healthy individuals under regular environmental conditions. Pareidolia are one such illusion and cause the observer to see things where nothing ought to be seen. In all of the above examples we are dealing with a form of gestaltian multistability and the reality presented is contingent on established associations. Experience aligns and associates those layers. Sometimes, alignments are off—animal camouflage relies on this disassociation; it can even stretch to behavioral patterns (mimicry). Figure-ground confusion can lead us to see ghosts in trees or faces in rock formations. If what we see is a question of whether certain thresholds of sub-patterns are met, pathological conditions are a matter of degree and sensitivity. </p>
        <p>“A person, that has lost a leg or an arm by amputation, endeavours for a long time afterwards to serve himself with them. After the death of any one, 'tis a common remark of the whole family, but especially of the servants, that they can scarce believe him to be dead, but still imagine him to be in his chamber or in any other place, where they were accustom'd to find him”, noted Hume. The phantom-limb syndrome and the rubber-hand illusion are strange behaviors that concern body parts. They rely on deeply engrained associations and a snatched scene that must match the record close enough; the rubber hand must resemble a hand and be positioned in a credible position to match the pattern. Pantomime creates objects out of thin air because we are so attuned to their presence in accordance to the remaining scene. This comes close to Helmholtz’ original example of stagecraft. Again, the actor’s skills decide whether the match is credible and close enough to meet the threshold for the patch to be generated. Deception is not left to the actor alone; the director can make use of the Kuleshov Effect to blend intertemporal events, in which the scene bleeds vertically into the next scene (since emotions outlast the moment) and warps its perception. Another irrationality, The White-Bear Problem, illustrates how little control we have over our thoughts which are forcefully determined by associations. The brain doesn’t understand the logic of negation; it only understands the impression of ‘no’ and the sound of ‘bear’. </p>
        <p>Hume gives us some clue where to start searching for the origin of those mental mishaps: “The only defect of our senses is, that they give us disproportion'd images of things, and represent as minute and uncompounded what is really great and compos'd of a vast number of parts.” Sense is ratio, proportionality, the relationship between events—nonsense is false equivalences and distorted proportions. </p>
        <p>Some very interesting insights come from the field of quantum cognition. Quantum cognition aims to model cognitive phenomena, particularly those that cannot be modeled by Boolean logic or classical probability theory—usually referred to as decision-making errors, fallacies of human reasoning, or irrational behaviors. Diederik Aerts’ Theory of Concepts, which might be more tellingly described as a contextual theory, fits neatly into our framework. Concepts change continuously under influence of context. This corresponds to the non-monotonic nature of pattern refinement in the matching process as new information is gathered. The event pattern under consideration changes shape and so does its meaning. Different states of a concept will produce different outcomes; asked for Car, Volkswagen Beetle might be the first choice that comes to mind; and asked for Fast Car, the answer might swing to Ferrari. Humean habit associates (entangles, in quantum-cognition terms) different concepts more closely together than others; Bear will evoke the activity Growl, and Horse the activity Whinny. Interference-like patterns can emerge under the disjunction of several concepts. Fruits and Vegetables produce different associations than the question for a good example for either Fruit or Vegetable. The concept Island evokes the association of water, palms, and beaches, but not in conjunction with the concept Kitchen. Aerts’ work focuses mainly on verbal aspects of cognition, but can be easily applied more broadly. If I encounter a scary-looking man in the street, my reaction likely is that of fear and heightened attention; meeting the same man in joyful company of my sister, my conception the same man might change entirely. The connotation contained in the concept Sister might tilt that of Scary Man into Protector.</p>

        <h4 id="section3">Section 3: As You Wish</h4>
        <p>Hume’s argument for determinism appeals to his understanding of necessity laid out earlier. To him, our idea of necessity and causation arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of nature. We have no notion of any necessity or connection beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference from one to the other. We get the notion of causation purely by seeing constant conjunctions and we do that just naturally by instinct. We find ourselves inferring B from A and as a result attribute a necessity to the connection between A and B. He applies this same notion of causation to the concept of free will. Human behavior is predictable in the same way as the physical world. The only situation conceivable in which humans would act entirely indetermined, is one in which “all the scenes of nature were continually shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each other, but every object was entirely new, without any similitude to whatever had been seen before, we should never, in that case, have attained the least idea of necessity.” If you look at human action you find the same sort of consistency between motives and actions as you find between the motion of one billiard ball hitting another. He shows how everything we do in life takes for granted a uniformity in the back-and-forth of behavior amongst people, and agents combine reasoning about physical things and reasoning about people’s behavior quite naturally all the time. </p>
        <p>We constantly manifest a belief in causation governing human action in everything we do, yet paradoxically, we deny any doctrine of necessity. We don’t hesitate to find necessities in other people’s behavior but we are quick to acquit us from similar constraint. “We may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves; but a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our complexion and disposition.” Hume thinks we deny the doctrine of necessity because we have a strong propensity to believe that we penetrate farther into the powers of nature and perceive something like a necessary connection between the cause and the effect. Hume wants to remind us of the fact that many beliefs in causality and scientific insights of the physical world we take for granted today, seemed strange and incomprehensible not too long ago. This admission that large parts of the physical world were also once unbeknownst to men could cure us of the illusion that somehow there is a greater necessity in physical things that than there is in human behavior. </p>
        <p>Another important argument that Hume makes is that morality actually requires determinism; it actually assists moral responsibility and doesn't undermine it. I can only be held responsible for an action that arises from the enduring aspects of my character, not an action that is completely random. It must have been brought about by my intentions, my desires, and my reasoning. An uncaused action would be entirely capricious and random and could not be attributed to any agent. “But so inconsistent are men with themselves, that tho' they often assert, that necessity utterly destroys all merit and demerit either towards mankind or superior powers, yet they continue still to reason upon these very principles of necessity in all their judgments concerning this matter.” Only the mentally ill behave unpredictable and nobody would attest them greater liberty. “'Tis commonly allow'd that mad-men have no liberty. But were we to judge by their actions, these have less regularity and constancy than the actions of wise-men, and consequently are farther remov'd from necessity. Our way of thinking in this particular is, therefore, absolutely inconsistent.”</p>
        <p>What is the sensation of free will we experience in every act? For Hume, a liberty of this kind involves “a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will; that is, if we choose to remain at rest, we may; if we choose to move, we also may.” He also suggested that free will might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience", which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. In a series of experiments conducted by Daniel Wegner people believed that their will shaped events even though those events were orchestrated by someone else. The experienced illusion of control was therefore not the driving force behind it but rather an instant justification. For the ease with which this illusion can be created, he called conscious will “the mind’s best trick.” The very act of paying attention may seem voluntary, but often it is not completely so. Indeed, if we are sincere with ourselves, we find that will and action are indeed always perfectly aligned. It helps to separate wish from will. If the prisoner stops hitting at the cell door, then he still wishes for freedom but he wants to return to his bunk. If the smoker lights up a cigarette, then this is what he wants at the moment; he still might wish to quit someday. The lazy kid might dream to become a professional athlete, but right now he wants to play on his game console. The alignment of will and action, so Hume, makes us “feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing; because when by a denial of it we are provok'd to try, we feel that it moves easily every way […] But these efforts are all in vain; and whatever capricious and irregular actions we may perform; as the desire of showing our liberty is the sole motive of our actions; we can never free ourselves from the bonds of necessity.” And since “all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones”; we are restricted to “compounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience”. Our imagination seems infinite, yet it is in fact “confined within very narrow limits”. </p>
        <p>Like Hume, Mill is clear that human actions could be “unerringly inferred” if their antecedents were known, but nevertheless maintains that this deterministic stance does not “conflict in the smallest degree with what is called our feeling of freedom”. The character of an individual is a function entirely of the experiences that individual has undergone. Individuals’ characters are the result of causal processes—and such characters determine their actions. Mill concedes, it would be of little consolation if our character and desires are beyond the control of an individual to influence. And he has some very interesting amendments to make, which fit exceptionally well into this framework. He points out, that we can influence our character and desires by placing ourselves in circumstances that modify our character. In this framework, we argue that what we call intelligence is mainly a function of ‘concatenation prowess’, the ability to form causality chains. By this means, the human event horizon extends farther and wider into event space than that of any other species. Mill stresses that human nature itself is malleable. Foresight—the major hallmark of intelligence—allows the organism to foresee how it will be affected by the environment and to choose it accordingly. This shimmer of choice is shattered by the Lewinian fact that any such decision to change in the future is taken in the here-now subject to the general rules of necessity. Closer to the here-now, necessity goes up and becomes overwhelming like the current in a funnel (in Latin: trajectorium = transition) whereas malleability goes down and the present takes shape. Compare this to a ball on a Galton board on its way to the bottom; the final slot becomes apparently clear with every pin it hits. A vague future becomes the adjacent possible and eventually reality. </p>
        <p>The world follows its evolutionary path—the combination of assembly and decay—no scene is exactly identical to the previous. Time separates one from the other. Decay inserts uncertainty into the equation. Surprise in today’s terms, spontaneity or indifference in terms of Hume. This sort of change from scene to scene, forces the organism to take decisions. And the way to deal with it is a certain degree of looseness or fuzziness in the interpretation of patterns. More uncertainty increases doubt and the time it takes to make such decision. Indifference is finally vanquished by the known structure contained in the scene pattern which determines the match of highest overlap. Hume didn’t believe in luck or chance. “Though there be no such thing as Chance in the world; our ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same influence on the understanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion. […] What the vulgar call chance is nothing but a secret and concealed cause”. We make up probability for lack of understanding. The future is determined by the present; that the system might be partly chaotic does not make a difference. Chaos makes prediction difficult, but chaos is still deterministic. Today we accept that some events on the quantum level are truly random (a position that might change as our knowledge growths, just as divine intervention disappeared from the equation). Random events are not influenced by anything; nothing determines their outcome, and there is no will in this. Hume was clear about the fact that a random event cannot be accredited to the agent (as such credit requires necessity). Free will should allow you to choose what you want, but then it's either determined by what you want—in which case it's not free—or, it's not determined—in which case it's not a will.</p>
        <p>Walking droplets on a pilot wave mimic Bohmian mechanics on a macroscopic scale. They offer a beautiful metaphor for the back-and-forth between the organism and its environment. Observing the droplet, one cannot come to reason what comes first, the walker or the wave, and which determines the future state. It’s a mutual relationship, in which one cannot exist without the other. The droplet shapes the wave and the wave propels the droplet in the air. The current state of the system is function of all previous states. Of course, the interaction of living beings with their environment is not always physical. It is predominantly symbolic in a Peircean sense and relies on sign exchange. Bohm himself compared it to a ship radar. The energy is provided by the boat engine, but steering depends on the interpretation of signs, for which signal strength is secondary as long as the sign remains decipherable. The organism detects patterns projected from the event space and reacts accordingly, thereby shaping its surroundings. A recent strand of research begins to highlight the neglected role of chance in life (‘nature’s secrets’) on a macro level; revising our view that every man is the architect of his own fortune and adding a modern spin to the ancient notion of fate and destiny. </p>

        <p>‘‘The phenomenon that distinguishes life forms from inanimate objects is semiosis’’—signaling, Thomas Albert Sebeok writes. And Charles Sanders Peirce held that “all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs”, where sign interpretation takes place in the here-now and more complex signs require a longer internal present. All thought takes time; “To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.” Life requires a time horizon strictly greater than zero in terms of the event-space framework. The field of consciousness (FOC) is generated from the fusion of sensory information and old sensory information, memory. Its shape is unique for every species. The organism can only know what the body allows. Its receptors determine the apprehensible event-space projection. A glimmer of light surrounds it; illuminating the vast darkness, nothing more than the glow of a firefly in the night sky and its trail along the past worldline. Most sensory information hits the organism without forewarning or very short notice. The only notable exception being eyesight. With the advent of vision, the observer was able penetrate the environment as far as the sun and to track events across space and time for the first time. The organism learned to make use of this additional information by exploiting its dynamic component. A cell can decide whether to let a molecule in or not as it knocks on its door. With eyesight, this detect-and-react cycle—the decision-making process—rapidly gained temporal depth. From now on, collisions could be intentionally brought about or avoided. </p>

        <p>For Alfred North Whitehead, the emergence of life is better conceived as a bid for freedom on the part of organisms, a bid for a certain independence. The entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it, but creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities. No species enjoys the high degree of independence of the human race. It conquered every corner of the planet and made it its niche. The adaptiveness as a race is reflected in a Millian malleability at the level of the individual. One is precondition for the other and vice versa. Our race relies on the extraordinary brains of its individuals for its achievements but the individual needs the group to tap into its full potential. The price of Whitehead’s freedom is huge. Large brains are very costly. Increased cranial capacity required the restructuring of the human birth canal and led to birth before the fetus is fully matured. This in turn led to prolonged and collective child-rearing. In the average adult human, the brain represents about 2% of body weight, but consumes about 20% of calories. We saw that freedom can be reduced to malleability, and malleability is a function of the organism’s time horizon. Thus, a larger brain buys us foresight and, at the same time, foresight is the currency to pay for a larger brain. Agriculture, livestock farming, and the invention of cooking, all helped to meet the increased energy needs of the brain. Any of these activities require extremely long causal chains and time horizons often well beyond one year. Yet, no organism alone can run such an experiment and risk to be left without nutrition. It requires a joint effort among group members and refinement over generations. Even our sense selfhood and awareness of mortality appears to be mainly a function of time horizon—obtained from ‘this-like-that’ (he’s like me) and ‘from-this-that’ (he was a baby, an adult, an old man) reasoning. Hume considered the self a ‘bundle of perceptions’.</p>
        <p>Spatial mapping and cognitive demands of toolmaking of the environment kickstarted brain development, but what really drove its expansion was the growth of social group size, that imposed greater demands on memory. A large brain gives individuals the means to forge strong social ties that enhance their personal fitness and the group’s social cohesion. All sign interpretation is dynamic by nature and the basic mechanisms had already been in place, when the brain learned to read longer strings of information. The development of vision was a major milestone for the interpretation of larger signs and promoted strategic behavior of animals—from eyesight foresight is therefore an appropriate condensation. Visual perception, however, is shared among almost all species, none of which share the same mental capacity of humans. It was the creation of language which turned the brain into full-blown time machine reaching over and above the needs of spatial planning. Human imagination stretches beyond birth, beyond death, beyond the big bang. </p>
        <p>Alfred North Whitehead wrote: “Nature is a theatre for the interrelations of activities. the togetherness of things involves some doctrine of mutual immanence. In some sense or other […] each happening is a factor in the nature of every other happening.” Forms of life quickly ‘found out’ that organisms react to certain patterns and that they could use this propensity to their own gain. Communication is the transfer of information from one or more senders to one or more receivers that affects the current or future behavior of the receiver. Plants communicate through a host of volatile organic compounds, colors, and shapes to attract and repel insects. Animal communication takes numberless shapes and forms. We can roughly distinguish between targeted and non-targeted communication. On one end there are forms of signaling like scent markings which ‘outlive the moment’ and are mostly detached from the sender. On the other end there are face-to-face encounters which are time-specific and receiver-specific; those are especially visual, auditory, and physical exchanges. We can also find forms of self-communication in the present (electrolocation, echolocation) or dedicated to future reencounters (e.g., indicating prolific or depleted food sources). Signals usually are established in coevolution of sender and receiver. The adjacent possible requires some tolerance or fuzziness on behalf of both parties—pattern creation and interpretation—for progression to be possible. </p>
        <p>A drop of ink dissipates under the force of gravity, but with the help of a nib we can spread it out and create shapes, says Julian Barbour. By doing so, we do what nature does—creating structure from existing matter. “Man [is] the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs”, a ‘symbolic animal’ as opposed to a ‘rational animal’, said German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. When we say the mind functions symbolically, we mean that everything is like something in regard to some aspect. Everything is a reference to a like-shaped pattern which is a like-shaped pattern of itself because it’s not the same thing it was an instant ago. Thus, when we speak of a metaphor, an analogy, a parable, a model, or an example it’s rather a matter of degree. Animal language, for Cassirer, is essentially a language of emotion, the expression of desires and aversions in response to environmental factors. ‘Animal language’ in animals and humans is genetically passed on. There is no need for a toddler to learn how to utter fear, suffering, joy, surprise; crying, laughter; many facial expressions are inborn features and widely universal. Man-made patterns, on the other hand, must be learned and be created in the first place. They are created in a Humean sense, that is, adhering to the Copy Principle. They evolve, gaining complexity and abstraction over time. Sophistication occurs within the limits of the adjacent possible. The producing, receiving, and interpreting organs must evolve in lockstep. “I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries,” wrote Charles Darwin. The very first sounds uttered by men were likely grunts and screams to direct the attention of group members, which quickly developed into exclamations of good and bad along the lines: “Look there, water!”, “Watch out, predator!”. Word that sounds like what it represents, onomatopoeia, are a logical next step. The coining of a word in imitation of a sound would allow it for the first time to mention things in their absence. As the human mind evolved to add spatio-temporal intuitions to mere sensation, a representational function overtook the mind’s merely expressive operations. </p>
        <p>Man-made patterns come in many forms: figurines, drawings, gestures, and sound patterns. All fulfill the same purpose—making private information public by eliciting an association in the recipient. They differ in availability, specificity, and versatility; By availability we mean the ease of pattern creation; a sculpture requires more tools and skills than a sketch, and a sketch more than a sound pattern. Oral pattern production had significant benefits on the sender side, as it left arms and hands ready for different tasks. Specificity and versatility suffer from a mutual trade-off. The more specific a sign, the less cases it applies to, and vice versa. This can be summarized in Peirce’ equation Information = Intension × Extension. Where extension refers to a sign’s object (denotation), and intension refers to the object’s characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign (connotation). In quantum cognition, specificity translates into concreteness. Non-locality means non-spatiality, which in turn is an expression of abstractness; locality means spatiality, which in turn is an expression of concreteness. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a neutron can either have a well-defined momentum or a well-defined location, but they are mutually exclusive. Membership of an item to a concept category is usually not as a ‘yes-or-no’ question but a graded notion. All states between the limit situations represent superpositional states with of varying degree of abstractness and concreteness. More abstract states acquire spatial properties like locations and direction only once submitted to suitable context; and, a fully determined concept cannot simultaneously be in two different meaning states. Massimiliano Sassoli De Bianchi gives the following examples ‘a cat’, ‘a cat owned by a celebrity’, and ‘Cameron Diaz’ white cat named Little Man’. Obviously, for the latter, infinitely more attributes could be added, and it still wouldn’t amount to a full description of reality (it never can because each moment is different—and indetermined). Examples from quantum cognition put the focus on the verbal realm, nonetheless the same principles apply equally to non-verbal context. </p>
        <p>Of all forms of communication, language is the most generic and versatile; it decomposes the reference into its perceptual layers. Once I sculpture ‘one fat black cat’, it is not easy to modify its characteristics; for language, it’s a matter of swapping words. A realistic-looking model has high specificity. A verbal description, however—no matter how long and detailed—will always leave room for imagination in the mind of the receiver. No two receivers will have the same internal representation and no receiver will have the same representation as the author. It would break the purpose of language if we consider the limiting case in which we assign a unique name to every scene. We could no longer communicate, as no one scene is identical to any other scene in all its constituents. Therefore, language is a balance of denotation and connotation that constantly adapts to changing needs. It was a stroke of genius when communication jumped on the ‘audio channel’ and hijacked hearing on the receiver end. Thought occurs in sound patterns. This becomes blatantly obvious when it errs. Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the distinction between sound image and imagination (French ‘image acousticue’ and ‘concept’) and the sound image is just that, a pattern only, ‘dumb’ on its own. Writing down a dictation or thought one easily takes a ‘few’ for a ‘view’, a ‘here’ for a ‘hear’. We need a larger match to correct our mistake. Acoustic images seem to have a smaller mental footprint than a visual image, comparable to an audio and a video files. It is therefore more ‘energy efficient’ to process and easier to associate multiple patterns into longer event chains. The other, probably even more important advantage is that the audio track sits idle most of the time. We cannot really do two things at a time. We can do them in a quasi-parallel manner, but that is not the same. We cannot listen and think at the same time. We cannot dream (‘visual thought’) and drive at the same time. In a deaf blind individual, the inner self ‘voice’ is tactile, often Braille codes; if thought didn’t occur on the audio channel it would have to be on a different one. The spoken word enlivened our imagination and facilitated thought as we know it. If it were visual, we could do it a lot less, we couldn’t think while walking or driving without constantly risking our lives. We would get stuck in disconnected flashes of imagination which would ‘consume’ much more energy. The inner dialog can therefore be considered a byproduct, or exaptation, of speech. Language, while initially a tool for communication turned us into the intellectual race we are. </p>
        <p>Animal language comes naturally, is innate, but man-made communication must be learned, innate is only the faculty to acquire it. The fact the children learn language effortless and naturally doesn’t contradict the observation that the evolution of language was a long and burdensome road of countless tries and adaptions. Toddlers learn to walk without instruction, but they do not swim; this is just how our body was formed under evolutionary pressure. Today we can learn to swim, but sacrifices were made to get us there (and some drowned). Language comes easy to us because our brains adapted to its specific needs, but nonetheless relies on broader concepts laid out in framework. Language follows the event space, applying laws of salience, gestalt, and Humean association. The first words a newborn learns are usually nouns; this is exactly what we would expect because it’s what we see first. We reasoned above, that physical objects were the first to be named at the origins of speech. It also matches our own experience as adults when learning a foreign language. It’s much easier to peg a new word to an object than to an intangible property, motion, or abstract noun. On an interesting side note regarding second languages, we can observe that new word patterns learned at a desk are less deeply rooted because they are not compaginated with the scene itself, but pegged to the pre-existing term in the mother language. Since the mental footprint of the acoustic image is so much smaller than a scene, there is less ‘substance’ to latch on to. For any learner, adjectives and verbs pose about the same degree of difficulty, as do simple prepositions. A word group that generally poses the biggest challenges are abstract nouns—simply because there is nothing palpable to associate with. They have also a tendency to be long, one indication that they are relatively recent on an evolutionary scale. </p>
        <p>Once the learner has mastered naming objects and motions (static patterns and dynamic patterns), he can go on to name complex patterns by combining and relating them. Sentences are the names of (dynamic) scenes. The blind Helen Keller writes about her experience: “I quickly learned that each printed word stood for an object, an act, or a quality. I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little sentences; but before I could ever put sentences in the frame, I used to make them in objects. I found the slips of paper which represented, for example, ‘doll’, ‘is’, ‘on’, ‘bed’ and placed each name on its object; then I put my doll on the bed with the words ‘is’, ‘on’, ‘bed’ arranged beside the doll, thus making a sentence of the words, and at the same time carrying out the idea of the sentence with the things themselves.” The pairing process is quite literal and follows the laws of salience and gestalt. Generally, the agent is more salient, resulting in active voice; sometimes the patient is noticed first, resulting in passive voice. As the scene grows further and gains temporal depth, tenses are added to the structure. Question-and-answer structures follow the match-and-patch pattern, in which the missing part is filled by the association rules of jump and roll. “Who is your neighbor?”, “XY is my neighbor”. Verbal logic therefore is much like puzzle solving by concatenating fitting pieces and substituting like-shaped ones. The same happens for a foreign-language learner; known words are matched against their base-language counterparts, bleed operations in the base language are then used to fill in the gaps, which are finally matched against the missing parts. </p>
        <p>Sentences are assembled from words by associationist rules, and the same occurs within individual words. Declension, conjugation, and the origination of new words from scratch follow the same list of creative mechanisms conceived by David Hume—compounding, splitting, mixing, blending etc.—which can be reduced to two fundamental processes—jump and roll—and, finally, one—the relevance rule of overlap. Let us quickly recall the two fundamental roads of reasoning: ‘this with that’ and ‘this like that’. Grammars are comprised of certain molds, which different structural units fit into. The English possessive and plural are some of the most obvious and most regular. Almost all languages feature declensions and conjugations; for Semitic languages we have triliteral radicals, which behave in a similar way as English irregular verbs, e.g., drink, drank, drunk. The consonantal skeleton is maintained while vowels are swapped according to certain rules. The gestalt rules of simplicity and stability would lead to a complete regularization in the long run if left alone and not thwarted by formal grammar. Children and new learners pick up the mold quickly and press all unknown words into the structure they know. They do so intuitively and accurately (on a sidenote, neologisms in schizophrenic patients give an insight into the ease of which minds make up new words when completely unleashed). Grammar would completely even out over the generations; the only things stopping them is printed rules. </p>
        <p>The same logic applies to spelling; spelling conventions are remnants of past variations and fusions. Without intervention, people would write as they speak. More dynamics follow from the rules of simplicity and stability: (i) Words become shorter in the long run, or, put differently, languages with short words fair better under competition, that is, when geographical borders are removed. (ii) Alphabets of higher abstraction are superior to alphabets of higher specificity (syllabary or logographic systems). To (i), Short words are superior because the amount of information retained in memory strongly depends on the time it takes to read a word aloud. One mechanism by which words become shorter, is by preferring a ‘convex’ word pattern, x-y-x, as opposed to a concave one, y-x-y; where x denotes a consonant and y denotes a vowel. This mold reduces syllable length because an additional vowel opens up a new syllable, and increases the number of possible combinations due to a higher number of available consonants. The reasoning behind (ii) is straight forward, the one-on-one mapping of sound to character is always preferable; we know how to write and read any word, once we have mastered the number of letters in the alphabet. Logograms are of low abstraction, like cave drawings, in which one drawing matches one scene; they are directly detrimental to the versatility language has to offer. </p>
        <p>The word stock expands and contracts in agreement with the organism’s needs. For a toddler, a seal, a dolphin, a whale are all fish—they match the necessary criteria, living in the water and having no legs. Yet, for a fisherman or a marine biologist those terms are grossly insufficient; they will differentiate by much more refined patterns, species, habitat, season, price etc. The close-enough-is-good-enough working principle of the brain applies to all of them. The same way words are added and removed from the individual repository, they are also added and removed from the collective word stock. New words and terms are created to avoid ambiguity as new event patterns emerge or existing patterns are discovered. ‘Cultural appropriation’, a tautology, is one recently created term for which the underlying event is as old as mankind itself. All culture is appropriation, always, following the Copy Principle. If an event pattern fades from the event space, the associated word also drops from the active word stock or will be repurposed. Most new creations never reach old age, but are outgrowths in the phase of trial and error and will not pass the test of time. Usually, it’s the latest additions that will vanish first, while core terms never become obsolete. Technological progress is a main driving source for the need of new labels. If the underlying event pattern mutates but main features are maintained, the name might make the transition too and pass on to its successor, as, for example, in the case of a (horse) car or (motor) vehicle. Tracing back the origin of a specific term, is for the most part and impossible task. Pattern generation occurs in the individual mind, that is, the birth of a new pattern can be ascribed to one specific group member. For a pattern to be successful and to take hold, there must be a pre-existing demand. That means, if the inventor wouldn’t have created the new name pattern, somebody else most likely would have (a slightly different one). At some point, the adjacent possible becomes the adjacent probable and inevitable given that sufficient external pressure builds up. </p>
        <p>According to Whitehead, there are no components of experience which are only symbols or only meanings. The relationship is inverted from things to words on part of the speaker, and from words to things on part of the listener. In this constant back and forth of snatch and patch, ‘memetic drift’ is inevitable. Fuzziness is involved at every step of the process. Evolution is the combined force of assembly and decay, or the ‘Copy Principle with mistakes’. This is directly related to the Inadequacy Principle governing the relationship between event space and mental content. A man-made pattern can never fully describe reality because we cannot even fully grasp it in the first place. Language evolved under these conditions. We have irretrievably lost its primitive ancestors due to its fleeting nature. Before audio recordings, there are no fossils of spoken language. Nonetheless, ancestral relations are all over the place. Living languages give testimony of the Copy Principle gone awry—a permanent point and miss of association: ‘mouth’ in Arabic sounds like ‘hunger’ in Portuguese, ‘hearing’ in French sounds like ‘understanding’ in Spanish, ‘starving’ in English sounds like ‘dying’ in German. This list eventually extends to almost all words if we would just dig deep enough. The above word pairings show at least three mutational vectors; drifts in connotation, drifts in pronunciation, and drifts in writing. </p>
        <p>Genetic speciation has its counterparts in memetic speciation. We see how mutually intelligibility and dialect continuums in geographically proximate languages can be compared to interbreeding of species, which are no longer are compatible at some stage or recognize themselves as possible mating partners. Physical barriers help in the emergence of new languages but oftentimes distance is enough. Most speciation is peripatric, driven by dispersal and migration of populations (allopatric speciation could be considered between continents before the arrival of sea travel; and regions like the Caucasus could be described as sympatric environments). More drastic breaks could be attributed to founder effects in small groups. Besides unpreventable evolutionary drift, the migrating group might have represented a small subset of the source population and not a real cross-section, or encountered fundamentally different environmental conditions, thus lacking sector specific vocabulary starting from the day of arrival. The need for new vocabulary could have led to new word creation mechanisms which then could have become self-sustainable in themselves, as in the case of the German compounds where basic words are cojoined to address more refined sub-patterns. </p>
        <p>According to the Copy Principle, all information must be learned. But if we speak of learning in the traditional sense of the word, we usually refer to high-generality information. We could say that such information translates to Relation of Ideas in Humean terms. These are basically cultural attainments. Culture also being used in Humean terms, as the collective form of habit. Language and scientific achievements being the prime examples. Those are former Matters of Fact which have undergone centuries and millennia of refinement, and as a result have been stripped of any impurities and specificity. Relation of Ideas are like spirits, highly distilled. What then is learning? Learning is habit formation, the repeated compagination of cojoined events. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system since all meaning is derived from context. In this context, Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms. </p>

        <h4 id="section5">Section 5: The Private and the Public</h4>
        <p>Hume argues that experience tells us that simple impressions always precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. if you want to give a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece of pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of the pineapple’s taste. You never go the other way round. Further, for communication to happen, this sort of pairing has to happen in the presence of all involved. Wittgenstein asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word ‘beetle’. Now, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each one claims to know what a beetle is only by examining their own box. If we can talk about something, then it is not private. And, in the opposite case, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot talk about it. The meaning must be broadly shared for communication to be effective. It also must be fuzzy as no two events are totally identical. Once established the first pair (the link to reality), we can chain additional abstract concepts such as synonyms or translations in absence of the first but presence of the second. </p>
        <p>Once a common basis is established, communication can go beyond redirecting the attention of the recipient. Above all, it allows to report events in absence and across distance. This fact is delightfully summarized in an Indian tale (which wants to make a different point, but illustrates the concept exceptionally well). It is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other and they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true. What we see from this parable is the potential of collaboration and division of labor that offers language. Furthermore, it only facilitates collaboration beyond the present plane. Each of the blind men could have made his observation at a different time, and still could share his experience as long as the group meets at some point. Information now became transferable horizontally—in the present plane—and vertically—forward in time. The temporal dimension opened the door to the accumulative nature of human culture. </p>

        <p>Compagination, the creation of relations and meaning, happens in the mind of the individual. For culture to happen, we rely on man-made patterns to communicate private knowledge. They act as intermediaries between minds; we will refer to them as hard information. Man-made patterns are one kind of hard information, to be precise. Soft information, on the other hand, is stored in the mind of the observer. We will highlight characteristics of both and their mutual relationship below. </p>
        <p>Hard information comprises all static and dynamic patterns observable in the event space. Soft information makes up the Realm of Consciousness (ROC) and resides in the brain of the observer. They are complements and largely opposite to one each other. Hard information is public—‘ta koina’ (τα κοινα), the common good—soft information is private—‘ta idia’ (τα ιδια), the private good. Hard information is ‘carved in stone’; it outlasts the moment, and, in theory, is eternal (even a sound can be recorded and stored). Hard information comprises, but not exclusively, man-made patterns. When scientists read out rock strata, and the farmer observes the weather, they interpret hard information. Soft information takes place in the present and is unrepeatable; no thought can be like any previous (it would include the previous and therefore be different). “We may assert, that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas not innate”, in Hume’s words. Hard information is, without previous knowledge, disconnected and non-sensical to the observer in a Humean sense. Constituents are present in an orderly manner, but there are no visible necessary connections. Soft information on the other hand is integrated and contains the relationships that help us make sense of the world. Yet, inside the brain, we would find information disassembled into its constituent parts along perceptual layers, values and relative positions. The assembled ROC would look like a movie studio, ordered like a theme park. Like-shaped patterns would sit back-to-back, freed from all unnecessary event-space content in between (this is why we don’t perceive time in thought or dreams), and connected through logical links (streets). Its public nature makes hard information sharable, while soft information is private in nature; it cannot even be shared with the same individual in the future. </p>

        <h4 id="section6">Section 6: Bigger than Life</h4>
        <p>To L.E.J. Brouwer, language is the means of communicating conceptual constructions; in this respect, however, the language is defective and unstable. The comprehension of a thought, its verification in another subject can lead to different results. However, rational considerations (e.g., mathematical) are, at least hypothetically, structured in the same way, and mutual understanding is possible through this interface. Incidentally, accuracy would only be possible in solitude and with unlimited memory. We can never read a text with the same intention as the author wrote it because we are not the same person in the same moment. Rational considerations are, as we have seen earlier, the condensate of human knowledge, stripped of unnecessary ballast—Hume’s relation of ideas. They have attained higher generality and abstraction through collective habit formation, or culture. Put differently, they have the least degree of scene integration. Accumulative culture has become possible through the invention of man-made patterns and their perpetual nature. They facilitate the sort of transactive memory proposed by Daniel Wegner. How much we really depend on ancestral knowledge is highlighted by the debacle and death of European expeditions in unknown territory which were destined to die when they weren’t taken in and saved by indigenous people. Knowledge from home couldn’t prepare them for the unexpected difficulties in distant lands. The local population on the other hand, knew which plants to eat and how to survive under adverse circumstances. Accumulative human culture relies on the transmission of information with high fidelity. Before the arrival of print and media, storytelling fulfilled the role with religion being the most successful story ever told. Pieces of information are easier retrievable when they are embedded in larger structs and receivers are predisposed to copy the whole argument chain rather than the isolated fact. Senders developed means like melodies, verses, variations or metaphors to reinforce their message with additional rigidity and coherence. All of which function like diagonal bracing in a truss and build upon jump-and-roll relations. Information sharing provides multifarious benefits at various stages of knowledge creation and knowledge retention. In the figure below, person A might only recall a portion of a formerly learned struct, yet his partner B might be able to retrieve the missing section. Similarly, the mind of Agent A might only be able to make a certain number of links in the yet-to-be-created struct (due to restraints deriving from the Copy Principle), yet her colleague might be able to make the missing mental steps. The partial struct B might also represent a note which calls to mind the adjacent branches in A, or a computational step assigned to a machine. The outsourced amount can be considerable owed to the contractional force of custom or computational power.</p>

        <p>Over generations, the individual doesn’t become smarter—nobody would argue that today’s scientists are necessarily smarter than Ibn al-Haytham or Leonardo da Vinci, or the average warehouse worker than a medieval farmer. But the individual can pick up where its ancestors left off, and the overall population unquestionably advanced. The ‘super-organism’ has a life on its own and matures. This is the sort of eu-sociality described by Edward O. Wilson. A New York Times column called Dairy of a Song describes how artists take inspiration in older works, copy, mix, stretch, and shift existing melodies in Humean manner to create something ‘new’. This is what happens in all areas of human ingenuity. Landmarks in architectural history reach back millennia and give testimony of the same creative dynamics. Hard information is passed on from individual to individual. Hard information fulfills the same retention purpose at the level of the single mind. We mentally pre-pair information to event patterns that we expect to encounter on our future worldline if we want to remember something. Hard information gives us the ability to physically pin those reminders, therefore increasing reliability and the amount of stored information. A person might pin a reminder on the refrigerator door because she knows that she will notice it there in the morning. Sometimes, when we want to remember a fact, we place us physically or mentally in the surrounding where the thought occurred to increase chances that the same patch is triggered. All those surroundings are hard information. Rain is a natural memory aid to remind us to get our umbrella; we only notice it later when this reminder was missing. Notetaking anticipates this process. The number of facts to be remembered is reduced to one; ‘in case of lost idea, consult notebook’. The importance of notetaking cannot be overestimated, considering that the largest amount of information is forgotten withing the first seconds and minutes after obtention. Thus, hard information assures that we must not start over again and again. Hard information has an expiration date because it relies on soft information and soft information is subject to change. On an individual level, I might not be able to recall the intention behind a note I took years ago; on a cultural level we are unable to decipher the Rosetta stone because the soft knowledge surrounding it has been lost. </p>
        <p>Lewinian life space gains depth and breadth as the organism grows from child to adult and finally declines, so does culture. At some point, a new species emerges that has features of its precursor—not starting from zero—that does things in a slightly different way. The success of the organism rests on specialization and effective cooperation of its parts; social collaboration and division of labor determines the welfare of the super-organism. Sign processing, the production and interpretation of patterns, is indispensable on the intra-organism level the same way it is indispensable among organisms. Sign processes build upon each other; simple patterns come first from an evolutionary perspective. More complex patterns can only exist on top of simpler processes. Bacterial biomass builds the substructure of the ecological pyramid on top of which more complex life forms can unfold. In a social context, scientists can only operate if the substructure (food production etc.) is intact. We have also seen that sign complexity is a function of time; more complex signs require a deeper time horizon. Collaboration and knowledge accumulation allow humans to study very large patterns like the Thirty Years' War, the Renaissance, or the Big Bang by extending the event horizon of the super-organism. As the FOC horizon deepens and widens, and as the mesh of observable events becomes tighter (through technological means), the number of ROC events and potential patch size increases exponentially. Most likely field size Π (from Greek, πεδίο = field), will render comparable outcomes to measure Ψ suggested by Integrated Information Theory. </p>
        <p>Karl Popper’s view of cultural evolution is closer to Hume’s animalistic instinct than Donald T. Campbell’s blind variation and selective retention. Popper compares a scientist’s quest for knowledge to a blind man searching for a black hat in a black room. The trial movements of the blind searcher cannot be completely random, for the very fact of the person’s being involved in a problem search implies that he is in possession of some knowledge. This knowledge, Popper stressed, serves as a guide, eliminating complete randomness. We have also seen that at some point the adjacent possible inexorably becomes the adjacent probable and finally reality. If Charles Darwin wouldn’t have published his theory of the origin of species, Alfred R. Wallace would have; if the VHS format hadn’t succeeded, Betamax would have. If Steve Jobs hadn’t invented the iPhone, somebody else would have because ‘the time was ripe’. All the pieces already were already on the table—mobile phones, touch screens, the internet—what was left, was to put them together. What is interesting about the Darwin/Wallace example is, that both men were inspired by the same book written by economist Thomas R. Malthus. Both shared roughly the same worldline and reacted to an external event in a similar way. This reminds us of our pilot-wave metaphor; Darwin and Wallace are two walkers at adjacent points on the wave; that is, they respond to the same societal events. We observe synchronization at all levels of nature. Oscillators start to couple because they transfer the mechanical vibrations through a common wooden beam in the case of Christian Huygens. People start to walk in lockstep on the Millennium bridge because the platform puts them in sync. As we saw in the case of Darwin and Wallace, the link does not need to be physical. A Southeast Asian firefly is only affected by its neighbors. The interactions are small and close range; yet, over time, you can see waves traveling through all the fireflies, and eventually, they're all flashing at once. Synchronization in humans seems to be very common because we are not as unique and independent as we wish to believe. The visible results are over- and undershooting in the economic cycle, tastes in music and fashion, living arrangements, or political opinions. </p>

        <p>Today we are inclined to believe that success comes from good decisions ex ante. Yet, if we pay attention to its roots, the word origins come from the course, the flow of time. It is determined ex post and generally measured in prevalence; what society came to like. Time appears to be the be-all and end-all determinant. There is always a ‘too early’ and a ‘too late’ to the game. Ideologies and opinions are hard to quantify, but we can put numbers behind economic success. Google and Facebook succeeded, while Yahoo and Myspace failed. There are probably many smart answers out there to why that came about. Any narrative is good enough—it must be the CEO’s morning habits (yet I know plenty of people who get up early to bake bread in a bakery)—but among all explanations, luck is commonly neglected. In our pilot-wave metaphor, the walker represents the agent, the wave the rest of society. Who affects who? If the on/off state represents public opinion can any one firefly in the flock be credited with having caused the final outcome (success), or any one user of Millennium Bridge with having set the pace?</p>
        <p>One exceptional thought or action is enough to completely suffuse society. It therefore makes sense to allow for genetic variety and specialization within the cohort, even if it means a personal disadvantage. Interesting insights comes from Simon Baron-Cohen. He says that autistic people are especially well equipped to detect certain patterns. By uncovering those formerly hidden regularities, they make them publicly accessible to other minds which couldn’t detect them on their own but are able to apply them once they are defined. Such outliers are found in all areas of life: science, music, or sports. Sports is a particularly suited case due to its competitive nature and measurable objectivity. Everything seems impossible until somebody does it, and once a new record is set it quickly becomes the new normal. Evaluating large patterns is impossible, or very, very difficult at the least. We see that when it comes to weather forecasting, live betting, or election forecasting. In all of those events, predictions are usually updated until the event has materialized. “Some theories”, David Bohm said, “are more coherent than others but it’s often hard to tell because when we come to a theory as broad as a worldview, we find it very hard to detect incoherence because the worldview tends to state the things that don’t fit are irrelevant or we are going to get them in order later. Incoherence can easily not be noticed. People also would like not to have their worldviews questioned because they have got used to them and feel comfortable with them. Therefore, it’s very hard to question a worldview. If you take the medieval worldview, it probably seemed perfectly satisfying to those people whatever wasn’t fitting, they said, well we don’t quite understand it or that’s God’s mystery.”</p>

        <h3 id="chapterIII">CHAPTER III</h3>
        <h4 id="section7">Section 7: Of Reason and Passion</h4>
        <p>Hume defined liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one's will; i.e., the capacity to will one's actions but not to will one's will. By liberty, then, we can only mean a power of acting or not acting. Hume also held that freedom is not only compatible with causal determinism, the absence of causation and necessity would make free and responsible action impossible. To hold an agent morally responsible, it is not enough that the action be morally reprehensible; we must impute the fleeting act to the enduring agent. What is it then that makes us act and on what basis can we be held responsible for our actions? The answer to both questions, according to Hume, cannot lie in reason but in what we refer to today as emotions. Hume understood feeling, rather than knowing, as that which governs ethical actions, stating that “moral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment.” We are not judging on basis of philosophical arguments, but on basis of feelings. In that case, causes that move a person make no difference to my resentment. “Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.” It’s sentiments of approval and disapproval that are the source of our moral ideas of goodness and badness. Recent psychological theories emphasizing the role of emotion in moral thinking have prompted renewed interest in Humean sentimentalist ethics. </p>
        <p>As for what makes us move or resist, Hume was equally clear. “Reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will […] It can never oppose passion in the direction of the will […] Reason is, and ought to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” Plainly the impulse to act does not arise from the reasoning but is only directed by it. “Nature has implanted in the human mind a perception of good and evil, or in other words, of pain and pleasure, as the chief spring and moving principle of all its actions. […] ’Tis from the prospect of pain or pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises.” Reason provides no impulse of its own but pursues knowledge of abstract and causal relations solely in order to achieve passions’ goals; reason provides information, in particular about means to our ends. As we saw in his account of causation, demonstrative reasoning consists in comparing ideas to find relations among them, while probable reasoning concerns matters of fact. Demonstrative reasoning discovers the abstract relations of ideas and is never the cause of any action by itself; reason alone cannot move us. Probable or causal reasoning does play a role in deciding what to do, but doesn’t function on its own; it always presupposes an existing desire or want. On his view, reasoning is a process that moves you from one idea to another. If reasoning is to have motivational force, one of the ideas must be tied to some desire or affection. “It can never in the least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both the causes and effects are indifferent to us. Where the objects themselves do not affect us, their connexion can never give them any influence; and ‘tis plain, that as reason is nothing but the discovery of this connexion, it cannot be by its means that the objects are able to affect us.” Yet, when we anticipate pain or pleasure from some source, we feel aversion or propensity to that object and “are carry’d to avoid or embrace what will give us” the pain or pleasure. Our aversion or propensity makes us seek the causes of the expected source of pain or pleasure, and we use causal reasoning to discover what they are. Once we do, our impulse naturally extends itself to those causes, and we act to avoid or embrace them.</p>
        <p>Hume distinguished two kinds of impressions, “and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul”: impressions of sensation and impressions of reflections. “The first kind arises in the soul originally, from unknown causes. The second is derived in a great measure from our ideas”, ideas being “the faint images of these [impressions] in thinking and reasoning”. “Secondary, or reflective impressions are such as proceed from some of these original ones, either immediately or by the interposition of its idea.” They include “the passions, and other emotions resembling them”. Whereas “original impressions or impressions of sensation are such as without any antecedent perception arise in the soul, from the constitution of the body, from the animal spirits, or from the application of objects to the external organs.” That is, “all the impressions of the senses, and all bodily pains and pleasures.” He concludes that their “examination belongs more to anatomists.” With these definitions, Hume laid out roughly the differentiation we will be using in this framework: Sensory perceptions and feelings are snatched from the event space, while thoughts, imaginations, and emotions are patched from the ROC. They are amalgamated, diluted, and more complex versions of the former. </p>
        <p>As life gained complexity, so did emotional life. Humans experience a broad range of emotional states, yet the experience is different from person to person, and even from culture to culture. The best analogy to emotions might be drawn from color space. All races enjoy the same visible spectrum, but not all humans ‘see’ the same colors. Berlin and Kay traced back the evolution of basic color terms and showed that the dedicated vocabulary increases with culture complexity, and it does so in a predictable fashion. For a new color term to be added, the pattern must be detected, delimited, and paired. This process is guided by salience and ubiquity of a certain color tone. It turns out that languages make cuts at the same place, only some make fewer cuts than others. All cultures have terms for black/dark and white/bright. If a culture has three color terms, the third is red. If a culture has four, it has either yellow or green, and so on. We can assume a similar kind of labeling for feelings and emotions. Indeed, the term emotion is quite recent in itself. No one felt emotions before the term was coined. Instead, people felt ‘passions’, ‘accidents of the soul’, or ‘moral sentiments’ and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today. Once a thing has been named, people start to spot and use it. Many cultures only see ‘blue’—Italians see ‘blu’, ‘azzurro’, and ‘celeste’. Not all cultures ‘see’ the same emotions and treat them equally. Children have no inborn fear of snakes, rather curiosity, but at adult age some basic emotions are almost universal across cultures. The same is not true for our relationship with more recent and more complex emotions such as pride and shame; these do not share the same degree of universality around the world. They also lack the same ingrained facial expressions as fear or joy. Another lesson, besides the demarcation of certain common color bounds, we can apply from color science is, how an infinite spectrum can be created from a small set of base colors. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Hume believed in a graded experience regarding strength and ‘tonality’: “'Tis evident, that the passion, properly speaking, is not a simple emotion, but a compounded one, of a great number of weaker passions, deriv'd from a view of each part of the object. For otherwise it were impossible the passion should increase by the increase of these parts. […] When good is certain or probable, it produces joy. When evil is in the same situation there arises grief or sorrow. When either good or evil is uncertain, it gives rise to fear or hope, according to the degrees of uncertainty on the one side or the other”. James A. Russell created a circumplex model of affect with the vertical axis representing the degree of activation-deactivation and the horizontal axis representing the degree of pleasure-displeasure. If we add a third axis measuring intensity, we practically have something resemblant of the HSL color model (for hue, saturation, lightness). In the RGB color space we create new colors by blending the colors red, green, and blue. We could interpret complex emotions as mixtures of simple feelings. Emotions are patched, and a patch is always a layered response, a trove of past events. According to Hume feelings precede emotions: “An impression first strikes upon the senses, and makes us perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain of some kind or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken by the mind, which remains after the impression ceases; and this we call an idea. This idea of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul, produces the new impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, which may properly be called impressions of reflexion, because derived from it. These again are copied by the memory and imagination, and become ideas; which perhaps in their turn give rise to other impressions and ideas. So that the impressions of reflexion are only antecedent to their correspondent ideas; but posterior to those of sensation, and deriv'd from them.” The primary perception is always stronger than its reflection: “Every one will readily allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination. […] The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation”. </p>
        <p>Lore has it, that reason and passion are in a relationship of rivalry, and in this warring, we ought to side with reason and restrain passion because emotions are notoriously apt to make us act in ways we regret. Hume was ahead of his time when he suspected that reason and passion must act in concert. After Hume, prominent cases like that of patient Elliot confirmed his intuition that reason alone is inert and can hardly move us to action; the impulse to act must come from passion. Without drive, you become undecisive. And if you don’t know what you like and don’t like, you don’t know what you want—you act randomly. From patient Elliot we can learn the two fundamental roles of emotions: (i) they act as a yardstick of importance mainly by shifting the time horizon and by binding attention; (ii) they assign value, and thereby steer the organism through the event space. Today, the evaluative role of emotions in rational decision making is widely established. Groundbreaking work was done in the appraisal theories of the 1960s led by Magda B. Arnold. She characterized emotions as ‘action-tendencies’. To her, emotion is this “felt tendency toward anything intuitively appraised as good (beneficial), or away from anything intuitively appraised as bad (harmful)”. Agents evaluate the situation in absence of arousal, and the resulting appraisal gives rise to attraction or aversion. Different agents can judge differently confronted with the same situation, and the same agent can judge differently at different points of time. Richard S. Lazarus, another advocate of appraisal theory, argued people make an automatic, often unconscious, assessment of what is happening and what it may mean for them. As the event occurs, thought must precede arousal and emotion (which happen simultaneously). </p>
        <p>According to Whitehead, emotions are closely entwined with the primitive functioning of “retreat from” and of “expansion towards.” He therefore refers to one of the key functions provided by feelings and emotions—steering. The second function—focus—becoming increasingly important as FOC gained depth and breadth. Both are two sides of the same coin. I cannot ‘retreat from’ or ‘expand towards’ a target if I lose it out of sight. More complex emotions correspond to more sophisticated relationships between agent and target than approach and retraction. Most feelings and emotions can be illustrated depicting the worldlines of agent and target in event space. Fear is an undesired, impending collision, anger an undesired collision that has already materialized, joy an accomplished, desired collision, surprise an unexpected course etc. The target object does not need to be physical; language has labeled immaterial objects which can equally pursued. Other emotions have no target or propositional object at all. This happens when the underlying event patterns has not been delimited and labeled. If I love or hate a person, this sentiment frequently addresses the whole event trove associated with this person and not a specific trait. Emotions can be even more unspecific; moods like depressions can encompass event patterns as large as a life situation, that is the self-trove. As for the grey tone in our color analogy, its individual constituents have become undiscernible. </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-landscape" src="images\aoth-emotions.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>The focus component of the emotion is still present in the case of moods even if there is no addressee. The agent focusses solely on the internal state, depriving attention from all remaining events around it. Focus, or attention, is a double-edged sword as it always entails a trade-off. Without focus, we couldn’t concentrate on anything, but it inevitably makes us blind for the remainder of the scene. In the face of peril, we solely focus on the source of danger and fear makes us track any of its moves; under the spell of love, we ignore any possible character flaws; and conjurers use misdirection and curiosity to distract us from the ‘real’ action. Skilled orators use framing and the positive or negative emotional connotation of certain words and images to nudge our ‘action-tendency’ into a certain direction. The main channel by which feelings and emotions wields control over our attention is by shifting our time horizon. Under stress, the system reverts to more primitive operational states. We discussed earlier that time horizon is what distinguishes intelligent life from simple life. It is the main ingredient of Millian malleability, our notion of free will. Reason (wish) is slave to passion (want), and passion has always final say. What I do, by definition, is what I want—I wish I would study but I want to sit at the beach (and that’s what I do). Before an important business meeting, I can choose to consume or not consume alcohol; once I’m drunk, I have no longer control over my actions. If I suffer from sea sickness, I can choose to board or not board a ship; once I’m aboard a ship, feeling takes over and I no longer can focus on any other subject. Judges pass harder sentences when feeling hungry; to be more impartial, they must anticipate their getting hungry in time. </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-portrait" src="images\aoth-pegging.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>In the here-now, the final decision is guided by good or bad—emotion is in control. But emotions come in various degrees, just as colors come at different lightnesses. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the focus on the present, the lesser the degree of malleability, and the lesser the ‘choice’. The field of consciousness is always a blend state of snatch and patch—the perception of new impressions and the filled-in—out-of-date, but good enough—information from memory. Positive and negative stress on the system affects the balance between both in favor of the presence, the snatch-patch ratio (SPR) goes up. Under heightened attention we learn more. Learning in this context is a broad concept. When suffering an extreme event like a car accident, every single frame seems to be burnt into memory. Usually, memory of such experiences is vivid and detailed, as if the scene was recorded in slow motion (on the other end, almost no new information is taken in when we are daydreaming). We defined time to be the number of events occurring between any two states. Thus, in this case more events have effectively been stored into memory, altering our subjective experience of time. The same is true for the life span as a whole. Curiosity, the driving force behind attention, in children is boundless, and childhood memories are plenty and lively. Babies look longer when presented with a new stimulus. Much more events are genuinely new at young age and much less information can be drawn from memory. In the long run, the organism prefers to patch scenes because it is more ‘cost effective’ than actively snatching information. The ‘well-travelled route’ flies by in an instant, and life in general ‘speeds up’—childhood years appear to be longer than adulthood years. Once a patch is served, curiosity to absorb new information is stifled as is the case of blocking of additional associations. This partly explains the reluctance to change in our opinions. </p>
        <p>Event patterns have the ability to arouse perceptible emotions in us—curiosity, fear, or joy. Once a train of thought latches on to a larger, pre-existing mental struct, it’s again sensations that catapult it back to our attention; we experience a flash of insight, or aha moment. It’s emotions that initiate and end the thought process. Feelings and emotions ‘send off’ a thought into the depth of ROC and send it back to conscious FOC, the here-now of the observer. When we discussed the nested gestalt properties of patterns, we saw that every pattern is composed of an infinite number of constituent patterns, and is itself a constituent pattern to a larger unit. If well-defined, consciously perceived (top-level) patterns are capable of triggering noticeable emotions, then we should expect, that smaller, subconscious (low-level) patterns equally induce much more subtle, unperceivable low-key emotions. These micro emotions determine salience and guide our perception; every recognition is indeed a small aha moment. The state of arousal decays exponentially with a sharp peak at start and a rapid drop off. This means that overall smaller threads can take temporal precedence until the globally larger event takes over and moves to the top of mind again. The biggest events pass the relevance filter outliving daytime hours and making it into the ‘nighttime perception’ of dreaming and long-term memory. </p>
        <p>In a way, emotions are responsible for ‘thread management’ inside the brain and ‘resource allocation’ of the organism. Besides of spotting ‘objects of interest’, they are responsible of keeping track of open threads and locking them in. Only once resolved, curiosity is extinguished, and the thread is released from FOC. Kurt Lewin observed how waiters keep track of open orders, and Bluma Zeigarnik further formalized how unfinished tasks are more readily available. It has been proposed that the brain has a natural propensity to detect irregularities in the environment. Yet it seems we are rather bad at detecting errors as the brain subconsciously mends the gaps, but once we detect inconsistencies, we often cannot stop noticing and thinking about them. Perception on its own is fleeting and lasts not even as long as the pattern is perceived—I can physically look at pattern but it will fade from attention, or hold an object in my hand and forget about. Senses are susceptible to change only. But it’s hard to forget about a hurting wound (feeling). Emotions work in similar ways; external event patterns are pegged to an internal event pattern (the emotion) which stays with the organism and outlasts the moment. The association works both ways: the event is associated with the emotion, and the emotion redirects to the event. The organism is now able to not only detect an event pattern but track it over time. At a low-key level, emotions are what holds a scene together in memory and allows us to experience the fluid nature of time and the peculiar thickness of the present plane. For reason and passion, it’s not ‘either/or’, but acting in concert of both. They behave like consonants and vowels in a sentence; consonants shape the sound and give it structure but are hollow and without temporal extension; vowels are dull but give it depth and reverberate. Only together they make the music. </p>

        <h4 id="section8">Section 8: Getting Better</h4>
        <p>“It is one of the principal Laws of Obliviscence, that when a number of ideas suggest one another by association with such certainty and rapidity as to coalesce together in a group, all those members of the group which remain long without being specially attended to, have a tendency to drop out of consciousness. Our consciousness of them becomes more and more faint and evanescent, until no effort of attention can recall it into distinctness, or at last recall it at all. It is there shown how large a proportion of all our states of feeling pass off without having been attended to, and in many cases so habitually that we become finally incapable of attending to them. A great number of states by repetition have come to do their work as signs with a rapidity which to our feelings is instantaneous, cease altogether to be attended to; and through that inattention our consciousness of them either ceases altogether, or becomes so fleeting and indistinct as to leave no reliable trace in the memory.” That is how John Stuart Mill described the process of habit formation. It is the process by which we learn and practice, and that shapes every aspect of our lives. It is the mechanism by which the unknown is eradicated from the environment and that assures that we stay ‘close to home’ and the organism stays within the boundaries assigned to it by evolution. </p>
        <p>Habit is the process of refining and perfecting. It is above all the process of removing the unnecessary and absorbing the constituent parts into an integral whole. We can illustrate the act by comparing it to the work of stonemason. The Gallery of the Academy of Florence is home to several of Michelangelo’s masterpieces—among those his famous David and a group of unfinished prisoners known as The Slaves. By cutting and carving the stone, Michelangelo treats the crude material and approaches the final shape. The final form represents flawlessness and perfection. The rock is no longer an agglomeration of grains; it has been forced into an undisputed unity. There is no doubt about what the final thing is; at every stroke of his chisel, Michelangelo removed one layer of the adjacent possible. Personally, I spend much more time in front the slaves, enjoying their brute force; they leave room for my imagination, allowing me to picture all the things that could have been. David, on the other is easy to grasp; there is no margin of doubt. This, in a nutshell, is what habit does—it facilitates life. Habit preempts volition, the degree of will constituting desire or choice, which separates the living being from the automaton.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-portrait" src="images\aoth-slave.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Let’s look at a few more examples of habit in action. If a person moves to a new town, she must learn to navigate her way from home to school or to her workplace—an active decision is taken at every corner, landmarks are consulted, the street grid is compared to its abstraction on the map using jump-and-roll reasoning. Six months later, she will walk blindly between the two places, paying no attention to landmarks, storefronts, or street signs. They are detected and attended to subconsciously—once you reach your front door, you frequently find yourself holding the keys in your hand already. All intermediate decision-making steps have been removed from the equation. The whole route has been forged into a single block—a single decision is taken to initiate it. Upsides and downsides of the before and after are obvious: On the upside, her mind has been liberated from active intervention at every junction; she can now mentally repass classes and prepare her homework, or contemplate her plans for tonight on her way to school. On the downside, she will miss out on all the events taking place on her way back because her thoughts probably will wander off. It is also very hard to break out of habit. Usually, she returns home together with her sister, but today she’s supposed to pick up her sister from a friend’s house. She will probably miss the street where she needs to turn left to the friend’s house and has to walk back a few blocks because she was walking on ‘autopilot’. By subconsciously choosing the known, habits are self-reinforcing. When practicing motor motion, we equally remove the ‘unnecessary’ parts from the motion flow. A gymnast will rely on support, a small child on his training wheels until the movement is sufficiently streamlined to be self-sustaining. Mnemonics also add additional ‘stepping stones’ which are later purged, once the struct in itself has reached stability. “All ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure: The mind has but a slender hold of them”, writes Hume. Attaching them to larger structs increases cohesion and makes them more readily available and reachable by jump-and-roll operations from within the struct. The purging nature of optimization is probably reflected by biological pruning inside the brain—unnecessary neurons are dropped from the ensemble just like their real-world counterparts. </p>
        <p>For Mill, forgotten ideas and feelings by definition lie outside the province of the mind and, therefore, beyond attention. He acknowledges the unconscious; the law of obliviscence intimates the presence of thoughts and feelings beyond the reach of mental attention. Attention is the bottleneck of action, and habit therefore sits at the core of multitasking. We can see how the concept of Humean habit formation relates to Dual-Process Theory; the only difference being its gradual nature and not a situation of two velocities. Fluency allows us to do multiple things at a time. What was unknown, no longer is so, and shifted to the unconscious; the salience frontier has been moved forward. Attention can be dedicated to new details, which went unobserved before. As attention shifts, habit is source and remedy of blind spots; new event patterns are observed while old ones drop from conscious experience. Just as habit has its counterpart in custom on the societal level, so does fluency in technological progress. An advanced economy has to dedicate less resources into agricultural production to yield the same output. </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-portrait" src="images\aoth-habit.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>Habit formation reaches much further down than what we commonly refer to us as practice and learning. Much ‘knowledge’ is innate and never was consciously programmed. Bodily functions like heartbeat, respiration, digestion, or feelings were taught by evolution and stand at the very bottom of the stack of habits. We do not need to ‘learn’ them and hardly ever consciously attend to them. Emotions are a borderline case. We saw that they are under cultural influence and stay in close relation with the experience of the individual. Their component nature turns emotions into a kind of super habit—they aid the organism to focus, steer, and communicate, all simultaneously. They set priorities, evaluate, prepare for action, and send signals to peers and adversaries without losing time. Conditioning involves these archaic response patterns. In the case of classical conditioning, the existing association is extended horizontally (in the same present plane); in the case of operant conditioning, the struct is extended vertically (along the time axis). As soon as learnt struct is (at least partly) observed (snatched), and sufficient overlap (match) is provided, the patch is served, and the behavior unfolds. In case of a vertical struct this means, the organism somehow ‘senses’ the future and anticipates good or bad or neutral outcomes. If a behavior is unconditioned later on, the ‘learned’ additions are eventually dropped and the archaic pattern reverts to its equilibrium state. </p>
        <p>Practice—training of motor skills—often causes pain from failing and pleasure from succeeding, but learning—absorption of theoretical knowledge—rarely involves observable, ‘high-key’ feelings or emotions. Only a subset of learnt event patterns entails feelings and emotions in the form of praise or punishment, joy or suffering, etc. The largest part is latently acquired. All learning is subject to rules of reasoning of jump and roll (‘this like that’ and ‘with/from this that’), which are summed up in the Relevance Rule of highest overlap. We are perfectly capable of transferring foreign experiences to ourselves, but this requires likening the other and her situation with ours, and concatenating cause and effect. We are also perfectly capable of learning from written and verbal accounts, which are then interpreted by our imagination. We saw earlier that every aspect of language creation and processing is based on the same principles of jump and roll. Yet, the biggest part of latent learning isn’t even identified as such. Every element perceived (snatched) enters the ROC’s knowledge stock, and every instant of recognition (patch) is re-added and recycled according to Hume’s Copy Principle. </p>
        <p>Hume was a skeptic of the human powers of reason and asserted that we cannot see anything beyond contiguity, priority and constant conjunction between cause and effect. “Nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets”, and the fundamental forces of nature are entirely inaccessible to men as we perceive only their sensible qualities. All our understanding arises from rigorous custom or habit, and not from any immediate knowledge. Indeed, we are not very smart when it comes to learning. Not only does all learning consist in imitation, even if mental, ‘dumb’ over-imitation is the rule. We are exceptionally well equipped in absorbing new information; this gives us the luxury of being quite unselective in what we take in. We copy everything because we cannot know which part of it will turn out essential eventually—we cannot perceive a necessary connection—and worry about cleaning it up later. It’s the stone block Michelangelo cuts from the quarry to shape it later. With age we become better at selecting, but with toddlers the raw process is very apparent. When asked for an object, a nine-month-old will look into the direction where she was regularly shown the item. When asked for a banana, she will turn her head to the kitchen. That is, her perception is rather in absolute terms of the scene, and not relative. Later, young children see the object before its parts (the car before the wheels, the doors, or the driver etc.), and are generous in grouping like-shaped entities into the same category (all legless or water animals are fish). </p>
        <p>John Stuart Mill regarded imitation ‘apelike’, and chose almost the same wording as the blind-deaf Helen Keller, when she describes her experience of learning language: “When I had played with [the doll] a little while, Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hands the word ‘d-o-l-l’. I was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like imitation.” She continued doing so, until understanding followed—unlooked-for and inexplicably. Repetition refines the event pattern by adding and dropping world points; unnecessary elements are pruned while the overall struct grows. The event core densifies and the bleed extends; the event gains connotation and access routes by renewed compagination from different scenes. You can teach a toddler to wave good-bye or applaud without understanding the concept of salutation or appraisal. Over-imitation is not limited to children; it only manifests itself differently in adults. We find that adults copy entire reasoning chains from the raw model and make them their own. Rapid adoption of new ideas combined with little scrutiny results in the typical overshooting we observe in all areas of social life—the economy, tastes in fashion, or music. Besides direct copying (or fake reasoning), there is a second attack vector abetting synchronization of group members, a shared worldline. Shared experience increases the chance to react in similar ways to new external events because brains will draw from a common ROC and will produce similar inferences (real reasoning). Synchronization also stretches into the realm of emotions creating a collective sentiment of elation or dejection. We observe that economic upswings often come with success in other fields like sports, arts, etc. Synchronization probably plays a role for social coherence to prevent Blochian non-simultaneity. As it happens, modern-day communication turned the natural protection mechanism on its head. Fissures emerge within societies as mental and physical location are no longer bound together. Human gullibility becomes more obvious as different group members are no longer exposed to the same stink. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h4 id="section9">Section 9: Mapping Thought</h4>
        <p>Hume posits that certain “qualities produce an association among ideas, and upon the appearance of one idea naturally introduce another. 'Tis plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association.” Individual thought-chain members are linked dominoes-like by ‘this like that’ or ‘from/with this that’ logical connections. Individual scenes are overlap in common regions like the rings of a chain. In structs, lines of play coalesce together becoming an unrecognizable black box. Structs being the rule, not the exception. Links can be well-defined, named top-level patterns, but most are subconscious, unlabeled low-level patterns or feelings. Equipped with the Relevance Rule of highest overlap, which can be decomposed into the mental operations of jump and roll, the concept of structs (or independent sub-entities in Bohm’s terms), which are the result of habit and custom, and the role of feelings and emotions in regard to focus and steering, we can try to ‘map’ thought in the event space.</p>
        <p>In general, thoughts originate in the here-now as David Hume observes. “The simple impressions always take the precedence of their correspondent ideas, but never appear in the contrary order.” And, “sensible objects have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this influence they readily convey to those ideas, to which they are related, and which they resemble.” This is in accordance with the observations from semiosis; in the beginning proto-consciousness was purely preoccupied with interpreting the present, completing current perception (VR) with a simple evaluative component of good and bad. Once initiated, “the fancy runs from one end of the universe to the other in collecting those ideas, which belong to any subject”, picking out “the most proper idea.” Foresight was the latest evolutionary achievement, and it’s most disposable. Under stress, nature reverts to its roots and most basic functionality. Stress, or a high emotional load in general, shifts the focus to the present and influences thereby the SPR. Thought chains become shorter in turn. Emotions (attention) not only instantiates a chain of thought but also keeps a thread alive by maintaining it in an unresolved state, and ends it case of successful resolution by throwing it back to the here-now. Most of the time, this cycle goes unnoticed; only strong emotions a perceivable as such, and only threads latching on to larger structs produce a discernable aha moment. But every act of cognition is a simple form of understanding.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img class="figure-square" src="images\aoth-FOC.png">
        </figure>
        <p>Conscious experience is a permanent blend state between the present and the past, and different mental states fall into a continuous spectrum across SPR values, in which only the weights of snatch and patch are shifting. In this scenario, dreaming is just one more mental state at the end of the scale, in which snatching is almost down to zero (a part from a few high-salience events and sensory incorporation) and all content is patched from ROC, eliminating what has sometimes been called the Integration Problem of Dreaming. In dreams, there are no worldly limitations to the mind’s imagination beyond the Copy Principle. There is no time in ROC, and dreams are not bounded to be timelike. We can only combine and mix formerly observed impressions. It is the state which comes closest to Hume’s prerequisites for unnecessitated decision making. Only in “scenes of nature”, in which “every object was entirely new, without any similitude to whatever had been seen before, we should never, in that case, have attained the least idea of necessity”. At the other end of the scale, there are high-concentration activities in the here-now, in which all thinking is inbound and highly vertical (time critical). In this flow-state of mind, focus is on the close environment like the next ledge while rock climbing or the ball in sports. It’s a kind of short circuit of automatic detect and react which consists almost exclusively of the VR component and in which AR elements from ROC are nearly absent.</p>
        <p>Classical thought and daydreaming fall in between the extremes with varying degrees of snatch and patch. Thought maintains a closer link to the event space, but involves knowledge outside of the here-now. Classical thought follows a triangular path through the event space; it starts and ends in the here-now with some processing in between. Daydreaming takes place on top of highly habituated activity or in the absence of physical activity (that is, only biological base habits like breathing etc.). Daydreams can wander off and go adrift, forming long, uninterrupted streaks because the underlying activity requires little active intervention. Daydreams are widely detached from the here-now, but not as unconstrained as night-time dreams because sensory impressions continue to be snatched subconsciously. In contrast to thought, daydreams feature more visual content. In the language chapter, we discussed that the audio track is more readily disposable for everyday navigation because it sits idle for longer streaks. Visual impressions however practically never pause. Thought, mainly hijacking the audio track, is also less demanding on the organism as it has a smaller footprint on the brain (large regions are reserved for visual processing). </p>
        <p>Much has been speculated about the role of dreaming, but even the latest proposals seem unsatisfying. A recent Defensive Activation Theory suggests that dreaming is a mechanism to combat takeover by neighboring senses because eyesight falls blind at night. We do not see during sleep, but neither do we hear, feel, or smell. Strong noise can wake us up, but so can strong light. So why should other senses have an advantage? The authors declare that dreams are mostly visual (to defend against other sensory input); but they are not exclusively visual, what partly voids the argument. Maybe, and more likely, content is just proportional to overall sensory intake in accordance with Hume’s Copy Principle. The authors mention that REM sleep in humans decreases with age and is more frequent in species with less pre-programmed brains. They conclude that higher neural flexibility makes brains more vulnerable to annexation and therefore needs more defending (dreaming). They further cite that blind people don’t dream visually at all (because it doesn’t make sense to defend it), and that the earlier in life a person goes blind, the less prominent is visual content. </p>
        <p>This framework invites us to come to different conjectures. Humean reasoning is based on the observation of cojoined events; instinct and intuition based on those relations stand at the heart of our problem-solving capabilities. Under regular circumstance, events are compaginated horizontally (in the same present plane) or in vertical proximity (along the worldline) due to restrictions in the attention span. But compagination is rarely pure; old information is served up from memory, recycled, and freshly compaginated (diagonal compagination). As long as SPR is high, traditional compagination outweighs diagonal compagination. At the same time, it’s this sort of combinations which goes beyond the readily observable and opens the door for out-of-the-box thinking and creativity. Thus, it could make sense in evolutionary terms, not to reign in such behaviors of thoughts going astray while the organism sits idle. Incidentally, imagination at night is less influenced by real-life situations and can run freely, leading to states of higher indistinguishability from a quantum-cognition point of view and resulting in a Bose-Einstein distribution of states. Indifference means higher abstraction, looser analogies, deeper integration, and finally more creativity. Reshuffling of ideas and deeper integration with older knowledge might prove a valuable investment as high reward may compensate for low probability, especially for an eu-social species capable to promulgate any rare finding. ‘Dreamt-up’ connections at night are become available at daytime; most of the time they might never be recalled or enter FOC partially as lower-level intuition. For a ‘night struct’ to be evoked, at least one its members must be currently present in FOC. If a dream pattern subsequently is encountered in the real world, overlap can be sufficiently large to reproduce a significant share of its neighboring content—to a degree that the border between real and fake memory becomes blurry. </p>
        <p>We reasoned that dreaming is mainly a tool for fostering creativity, integration and consolidation of the ROC stock. New knowledge is anchored in old knowledge through diagonal compagination. At day, as need arises, this relationship is inverted. Thus, day and night behave as ebb and flow for information. What role then plays the remainder of the night in which we don’t dream? During the day, feelings and emotions are in charge of thread management, setting priorities and keeping track of open tasks. The remaining time of the night in which we don’t dream must therefore reset and calibrate this weighting mechanism in order to avoid compounding effects. Different daytime events gave cause to different feelings and emotions of various magnitude. Lower peaks melt of faster than higher peaks; it’s the highest peaks that are deemed relevant and that make it into our dreams. The different stages of sleep are cyclically organized. We will distinguish between the local circadian cycle, and the global cycle that stretches over an organism’s life span. When ‘conceiving’ the global sleep cycle, ‘life-long learning’ was not a priority. Life was long enough to assure successful procreation. Learning was reserved for the offspring; adults were plenty busy procuring food and protecting the kindred. Nowadays, ‘creative types’ have a reputation to enjoy more sleep than ‘executive types’. Regarding the local sleep cycle, splitting the stages of sleep into several repeating cycles has two important advantages. Firstly, if the night is interrupted untimely, chances are bigger that every stage was run through at least once. Secondly, a slight phase shift in adult group members, warrants a more even alertness throughout the night. The breeding ground was riddled with natural enemies, and uncertainty prevailed about how long undisturbed night’s sleep would last. </p>
        <p>Different states of mental activity produce different signatures of brain-wave activity against a background of constant noise (the model or world view being held in place). While all people go through all states of mental activity, they do so to different extents. Different mental states are more or less representative for different personality types; they spend more or less time in them (and we should be able to find signature brain-wave patterns for personality types). An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding explains, “Where there is a complication of causes to produce any effect, one mind may be much larger than another, and better able to comprehend the whole system of objects, and to infer justly their consequences. One man is able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater length than another. When we reason from analogies, the man, who has the greater experience or the greater promptitude of suggesting analogies, will be the better reasoner”. The ‘nutty professor’ seems to be ‘spaced out’, always with one foot in the past and foot in the future, detached from the banalities of the present. The professional athlete on the other hand, cannot afford the luxury to be absent in the presence; both hands and feet are needed in the here-now to get the job done. He probably spends very little time contemplating the origin of the universe and distant galaxies even outside the pitch. It would be detrimental to his professional success. Simon Baron-Cohen has made some very intriguing observations according to which certain societal outliers are better at spotting certain patterns. We could add, that not only are some better at recognizing them, even others might be especially good at creating them (as in the case of a gymnast or musician). Yet, the outlier position comes at the cost of a trade-off—more of one means less of another. According to Baron-Cohen, this propensity towards a certain pattern range expresses itself in autistic behavior. It’s some sort of genetic skewness which fits into a race whose entire success is built on specialization, division of labor, and collaboration. He states that most of society’s most extraordinary achievements were originally brought about by those outliers. </p>
